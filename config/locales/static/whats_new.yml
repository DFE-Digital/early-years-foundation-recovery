          We’ve added a few things since you were last here. 
        </div>

        ## Videos

        We’ve added videos to modules 1, 2 and 3.
        These videos will enhance your understanding of a specific area of child
        development and how it applies to your practice.
        Each video has captions and a transcript.
        You can look out for these videos as you go through the training.

        ## In your setting practical tips

        Look out for the information icon where you will find practical tips to 
        use in your setting.

        $INFO
        You should provide activities that require children to share resources and
        take turns. This will help them to develop problem solving and co-operation
        skills.

        ## Reflection points

        We’ve replaced practitioner prompts with reflection points.
        This is a chance to reflect on what you’ve learned and how it applies 
        to your practice.

        $BRAIN
        Reflect on what you have read about supporting children’s individual development.

        Consider the following questions:

        - What information do you gather to understand each child’s starting point?
        - Who do you involve?
        $BRAIN


        ## Learning log

        You now have a space to make notes on reflection points. When making your notes, do not enter any personal or sensitive information like children's names.
        You can view all your notes in your personal learning log.
        You can access your learning log from the main menu and from any page where the learning log appears.
