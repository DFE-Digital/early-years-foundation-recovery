          We’ve added a few things since you were last here. 
        </div>

        <h2>Videos</h2>

        We’ve added videos to modules 1, 2 and 3. These videos will enhance your 
        understanding of a specific area of child development and how it applies 
        to your practice. Each video has captions and a transcript. You can look 
        out for these videos as you go through the training.

        <h2>In your setting prompts</h2>

        The information icon highlights practical tips to use in your setting. 

        $INFO

        You should provide activities that require children to share of resources
        and take turns. This will help them to develop to promote problem solving
        and cooperation skills. 

        $INFO

        <h2>Reflection points</h2>

        We’ve replaced practitioner prompts with reflection points. This is  a
        chance to reflect on what you’ve learned and how it applies to your practice.

        $BRAIN

        Reflect on what you have read about supporting children’s individual development.

        Consider the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What information do you gather to understand each child’s starting point?</li>
          <li>Who do you involve?</li>
        </ul>

        $BRAIN

        <h2>Learning log</h2>

        You now have a space to make notes on reflection points. You can view all
        your notes in your personal learning log. You can access your learning log
        from the main menu and from any page where the learning log appears.
