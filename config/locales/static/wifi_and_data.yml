        The Early years child development training will use mobile data when your
        device is not connected to the internet or wifi. The videos in the training
        will use a larger amount of data than a text page. We recommend that you
        connect to the internet or wifi to do the training and watch any videos.

        The following resources can help, if you have limited or no access to the
        internet, wifi or mobile data. 

        ## Free wifi in your area

        Many local authorities offer free wifi in city centres and government
        buildings, like libraries. There may be information on your local authority's
        website about accessing free wifi in your area.

        [Find your local authority website](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council). 

        ## Online Centres Network

        Online Centres Network provide access to the internet and help using it.
        Some centres also offer training courses. These services are usually free.
        [Enter your postcode](https://www.gov.uk/ukonline-centre-internet-access-computer-training)
        to search for centres in your area.

        ## Guest internet access in schools and early years settings 

        If you are a practitioner in a school or early years setting, they may
        have a policy to allow guest users to access their internet network. If
        this is the case, you will be able to connect to the internet on your own
        device. 

        ## Support for small businesses and community organisations

        If your early years setting has limited or no internet access, you may
        be able to get government support to help.

        ### Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme

        Your setting may be eligible for the government's
        [Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme.](https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/for-businesses/)
        The scheme offers grants to help improve internet access in rural areas. 

        [Check if your setting is eligible.](https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/) 

        ### The National Databank

        The [National Databank](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/databank/)
        provides free data for community organisations.
