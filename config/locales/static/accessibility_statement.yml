        This accessibility statement applies to Early years child development training.

        This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people
        as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you
        should be able to:

        * change colours, contrast levels and fonts
        * zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
        * navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
        * navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
        * listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most
          recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

        We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">
        AbilityNet (opens in a new tab)</a> has advice on making your device
        easier to use if you have a disability.

        ## How accessible this website is

        We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

        * If you disable javascript in your browser, the alert to tell you that you will soon be signed out due to inactivity may not appear as we intended it to
        * Our sitemap includes only the pages that do not need you to be signed in - this is because once you have started a module, you will need to work through each page in order

        ## Feedback and contact information

        If you need information on this website in a different format like
        accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, email <a href="mailto:child-development.training@education.gov.uk"

        We'll consider your request and get back to you in 10 days.

        ## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

        report these issues and contact details for the unit or person responsible
        for dealing with these reports].

        ## Enforcement procedure

        The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing
        the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2)
        Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you're
        not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a rel="noopner noreferrer" href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" target="_blank">

######Do we need this bit? Or can we use the stuff from the compliant version??

        ## Compliance status

        This website is partially compliant with the WCAG version 2.1 AA standard,
        due to the following non-compliances (and/or) the following exemptions.

        ### Non-accessible content

        The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s):

        #### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

        * [Some images don't contain alternative text to describe the image
        which does not meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">
        WCAG version 2.1 AA - 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>]</li>

        #### Disproportionate burden

        We have determined that there is disproportionate burden to meet all the
        requirements for the following reasons:

        * [Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the
          department unable to do other work - and would not significantly improve
          things for disabled users.]

        #### The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

        * [PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are out of
        scope of the regulations.]
