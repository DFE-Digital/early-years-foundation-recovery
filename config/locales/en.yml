      This end of module test is here to revisit what you have learned and the

      ## Before you start

      This test has 10 multiple choice questions.

      You must answer all of the questions.

      You can pause and restart the test as much as you like. If you exit part way through, your progress will be saved.

      You can review your total score for the test at the end.

      To receive a certificate of achievement for this module, you need to receive an overall score of at least %{passmark}%.

      If you do not score %{passmark}%, you will be able to see which questions you got wrong. You can repeat the test to improve your score as many times as you want.

      Your score may be shared anonymously with the Early years child development training team to help DfE measure the impact of this training.

      Scores are not shared with any other third parties or organisations.

  confidence_intro:
    heading: Reflect on your learning
    body: |
      To help DfE to measure our impact, please answer the following questions.

      You must complete these questions in one sitting. If you exit part way
      through, your progress will not be saved.

      Answers will be anonymous, and we will not know what you individually select.

      Please rate to what extent you agree with the statements on the following pages.

      You can sign out or close the browser at any time without losing your progress.
      When you next sign in, you can restart from where you left off.

      ## Videos and mobile data usage

      This module contains videos. Connect to wifi before starting the module to
      watch the videos without using any mobile data. If you are not able or prefer
      not to play the videos, you can use the full transcripts provided.

      ## Free wifi, internet and data resources

      Our [free wifi, internet and data resources](/wifi-and-data) may help if you have limited or
      no access to the internet.

      ## Learning check

      You’ll see the question mark icon next to quiz questions throughout the module.
      These questions are to check you understand what you have learned.
      You will be able to see if you get these questions right or wrong.
      Your scores are not recorded and they do not count towards the certificate of achievement.
