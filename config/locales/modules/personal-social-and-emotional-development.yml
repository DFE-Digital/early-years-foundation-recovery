          On completion of this module you will be able to: 

          - establish and explore the stages of children’s personal, social and emotional development
          - discuss the importance of effective relationships
          - explore factors affecting behaviour
          - explain and explore the role of self-regulation 
          
          From birth to 5 years old children will experience rapid growth in all areas of development, including their awareness of personal, social and emotional skills.
          
          It’s important to understand developmental patterns and how progress in this area will impact children holistically.  Children will need support to learn, develop and rehearse key skills, including how to: 
          
          - understand and manage their feelings
          - build and maintain relationships
          - manage their behaviour in line with social expectations
          
          The impact of any difficulty in mastering these skills will be seen across all other areas of development. 
          
          As communication and language underpin all other areas of development it is essential that children develop the skills to express themselves and their needs.

        body: |
          Developing their personal, social and emotional skills is crucial in helping children to:

          - understand and process their own feelings and the feelings of others
          - build and maintain positive relationships
          - understand social situations
          - develop self-control
          - manage their behaviour

          The first section of this module includes:

          -	how children develop personal, social and emotional skills
          - how you can support children’s skill development
          - how social and emotional skills affect children’s behaviour
      3-1-1:
        heading: The stages of children’s personal, social and emotional development
        body: |
          Furthering your knowledge of children’s personal, social, and emotional development will reinforce your understanding of how these skills can help them develop in other areas. For example, children who are able to successfully develop confidence and positive self-worth will approach tasks with higher self-efficacy than children who lack those skills. In turn, this will help to improve their physical, language and communication skills.

          Your role as a practitioner is to help children become self-aware, confident communicators, who are curious to try new things and able to build positive relationships with others. 

          This topic includes: 
         
          - Social and emotional development:
            - before birth and young babies 
            - 12 months to 2 years old
            - 2 to 3 years old
            - 4 years old
          - Stages of social and emotional development

          Development Matters (2021) shows us the skills children will be learning and working towards. Over the next few pages we will take a closer look at the expected milestones for personal, social and emotional development between birth and the age of 5.

          As always, it is important to remember that while we will discuss the expected milestones of development, every child will develop at their own rate. No child should be considered as low ability in comparison to these milestones. Some children may require additional support to reduce gaps in learning that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and every child should be supported to achieve their full potential. 
          
          Research suggests that emotional development begins even before a baby is born. By the sixth month of pregnancy, babies’ hearing is nearly fully formed and they are becoming more aware of their environment in the womb. 
          
          At birth, a baby will communicate and show their feelings by crying. At first, they will only smile as a reflex, but by 6 to 8 weeks smiling becomes a controlled response to show happiness and pleasure.
          
          To help with their emotional development, babies need lots of:
          
          - eye contact
          - positive facial expression
          - reassurance
          - cuddles
          - comfort when crying 

          In your setting, babies also need to hear lots of new language to help them to learn, develop and rehearse new vocabulary. Babies will benefit from plenty of talking, singing and general conversation to reinforce their understanding.  
      3-1-1-2:
        heading: "Social and emotional development: 12 months to 2 years old"

          ![Four young children in a baby room. The two children in the foreground are smiling and looking up. There are two practitioners in the background.](/assets/3-1-1-2-468483760.jpg)
          
          ##0 to 12 months 
          
          In the first 12 months of life, you will notice that babies will remain shy or nervous with strangers and will still cry when their familiar parent or carer leaves. They will already have favourite things, for example they may show you a favourite book to read together. This is a great opportunity to engage in conversation and take an interest in things that are important to them.   
          
          In your setting, it’s important to look out for attempts to communicate. These may include simple gestures, such as shaking their head for no or waving goodbye, or verbal communication, such as making sounds with different tones. Acknowledging and responding to these communication attempts will support babies to feel valued and important and will encourage further communication development as they try to copy the words that you say. 
          
          Babies will enjoy playing games such as “peek-a-boo” and “pat-a-cake”, as they will like the eye contact and adult interaction involved. This will also help them to repeatedly test the concept of object permanence.
          
          ##12 to 18 months
          
          Between 12 and 18 months, children will dislike sharing and will be happier playing alone. They will have a sense that items belong to them and may fight with others if they are expected to share. Children of this age will want to do things independently but will not always have the ability to do so. They may also become easily frustrated, which could quickly result in tantrum-like behaviour. At this age, children will be happy to separate for short periods and will enjoy being able to copy adult behaviours like cooking and driving. 
          
          ##18 to 24 months
          
          At between 18 and 24 months old, children may still be afraid of strangers, which will leave them clinging to familiar caregivers in new situations. They will show affection to familiar people and be happy to explore alone if a parent or carer is nearby.
          
          Communication will now include pointing to things they want and things they find interesting. Shaking their head might now be accompanied with the word no. Children’s frustrations may be shown as temper tantrums.
          
          At this stage it is important that you support toddlers to:
          
          - become problem solvers by allowing sufficient time for them to try things for themselves without rushing. This could include activities, such as puzzles, and everyday routine tasks, such as trying to put a foot in a shoe or an arm in a coat
          - resolve conflict by explaining how their actions have made others feel and the importance of saying sorry 
          - participate in joint play opportunities through adult led paired and small group activities
          
          The observation checkpoints in Development Matters ask us: 
          
          <blockquote>
          “Around 7 months, does the baby respond to their name and respond to the emotions in your voice?”
          “Around 12 months, does the baby start to be shy around strangers and show preferences for certain people and toys?”
          “Around 18 months, is the toddler increasingly curious about their world and wanting to explore it and be noticed by you?” 
          </blockquote>

          ![A baby lying on its tummy on a sofa. There are some toys in front of the baby and the baby is smiing.](/assets/3-1-1-3a-507032862.jpg)

          At 2 years old, children will be copying those around them. They will get excited to be with other children, even though they continue to mainly play alongside others and not with them. They will start to play imaginative games and become more independent, although this may also be accompanied by increased defiance. 
          
          Toddlers will have a better understanding of themselves as individuals, but with this will come a wider range of more complex feelings. In your setting, you should name and discuss feelings to help toddlers process them.
          
          At around 3 years old, children will be showing more affection for friends and will visibly show concern when friends are upset. Using spontaneous and planned activities to help children to discuss their feelings will further support their self expression. 
          
          Spontaneous activities can include encouraging children to explore their feelings when accidents and conflict occur. Planned activities can include:
          
          - shared stories
          - role play 
          - games where the children match facial expressions with feelings
          - feelings flashcards
          
          Children of this age will have a better understanding of the concept of ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’ and will be able to take turns in activities. You can provide activities that require sharing of resources or taking turns to promote problem solving and cooperation.
          
          Children will now find it easier to separate from their parent or carer, but may still struggle with major changes to their routine. They will be becoming more independent with skills such as dressing and undressing and enjoy playing make believe. In your setting, providing opportunities and materials for purposeful role play will give children the chance to explore their wide range of feelings. 
          
          By 3 years old, most children will be able to have a conversation using 2 to 3 sentences at a time. However, each child’s developmental levels will be dependent on the influences they have experienced up to that point. For example, if children are coming into a childcare setting for the first time, their current level of understanding will have been shaped in the home environment. Children will have been dependent on their early social experiences and environments to support their understanding. 
          
          The observation checkpoints in Development Matters ask us:
          
          <blockquote>
          “Around the age of 2, does the child start to see themselves as a separate person? For example, do they decide what to play with, what to eat, what to wear? Between the ages of 2 and 3, does the child start to enjoy the company of other children and want to play with them?” 
          </blockquote>

          At around 4 years old, children would rather play with others than alone. They will be making friendships and forming bonds with their peers. At this age, children’s cooperation skills will be improving and they will be more aware of the feelings of others. In your setting you should take opportunities to encourage both child led and adult led activities. Children’s play will also be more creative, with an increase in purposeful imaginative play. For example, you will likely see them using role play to act out significant figures in their lives. Providing child led opportunities to explore and express their thoughts and feelings will help children to navigate relationships.
          
          Some children will now talk more about what they like and what they are interested in and will have more of their own opinions and beliefs. You should support children to explore these in a child led way, and give adult led opportunities to discuss them. 
          
          Some children may also still have difficulty regulating their emotions and need lots of opportunities to discuss and explore feelings. This can be done through activities such as shared stories, opportunities for creativity and adult led discussion. These activities will also be particularly useful for children with autism.
          
          Around this age, children will be more aware of the world around them. You should encourage their curiosity by: 
          
          - providing a wide variety of books, materials and experiences, covering topics such as cultures, religions, how things work and the natural world
          - planning trips and visits to the setting
          - offering open ended materials that can be used in multiple ways, such as sand and arts and crafts equipment

          By 5 years old, children will be more likely to agree with rules, but will still move between periods of cooperation and periods of demanding behaviour. You should create opportunities to encourage children to explore and understand their feelings to help them to further develop their resilience. 

          You can do this by:
          
          - talking about feelings, which will help children to manage challenging emotions like disappointment and frustration 
          - encouraging children to embrace mistakes and learn from them, which will make them less afraid to make mistakes in the future 
          - giving children responsibility 
          - supporting children to understand that their actions have consequences 

          At this age, children will want to please others and will be able to take part in activities and tasks that involve cooperation and direction. They will be choosing their own friends and will see characteristics in friends that they would like for themselves. 

          Children of this age will also be able to distinguish between what is real and imaginary, and will show concern and sympathy for others. 
          
          They will have their own opinions to share and will be asking lots of questions to shape their thoughts. In your setting, make sure that children experience diverse environments, conversations and roles to help them to develop broad and informed opinions and views.

          As an early years practitioner you play a significant role in supporting the development of children’s personal, social and emotional skills.

          Further developing your knowledge and understanding of child development milestones will ensure that you choose the appropriate support strategies to help children progress. 

          This topic includes: 
          
          - Strategies to support personal, social and emotional development 
          - An inclusive approach to personal, social and emotional development

          ![A practitioner with two children during snack time. The practitioner is making eye contact with one of the children and listening to what they are saying. ](/assets/3-1-2-1-140080209.jpg)
          
          In your practice, you should help children to develop key personal, social and emotional skills and qualities, like:

          - self-worth - how important they feel
          - self-efficacy - how likely they are to attempt a task, based on how likely they think it is that they’ll be successful
          - self-awareness - their knowledge of their own character and feelings
          - self-confidence - how they feel about their abilities
          
          These skills will in turn aid children’s development in all other areas.

          In this section, we will explore the different strategies you can use to encourage children’s personal, social and emotional development.

          ##Active listening
          
          Children, like adults, feel important when they feel valued. This starts right from birth when a baby cries and receives affection. You can help children feel valued by making eye contact and coming down to the child’s level where possible. This will help them feel listened to and encourage their engagement, which will promote further communication. 
          
          Avoid making children feel rushed. Where appropriate, try to ask questions, as this will help them to build their vocabulary and communication skills.
          
          Listen to even the smallest of things, even when they might feel insignificant, as children will then feel comfortable to come to you with the bigger things. 

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Choose a familiar or nominated item, such as a bear or talking stick, and ensure that children know that it is their turn to speak when they have the nominated item.  </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Make sure that: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>the rest of the group listen to the friend who has the item </li>
              <li>the item is passed around during group discussion activities </li>
              <li>everyone gets the chance to have the item at some point in a given time period, such as a day  </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body"> This will ensure that conversation is not dominated by a given few and will support those lacking in confidence to feel important.  </p>      
            </div>

          ##Promote choice
          
          Ensuring that children feel that they have a choice will support them to feel valued, important and in control of their development. Offering choice, no matter how small,  will lead to better choice making in the future. Small choices, such as the decision between peas and carrots, may lead to larger choices, such as choosing between right and wrong.  
          
          Being able to choose a task the children know they can complete will increase their self-efficacy when they are able to succeed. More difficult tasks can then be scaffolded appropriately.
          
          Offering children choices will promote independence and encourage them to consider the consequences of their actions.

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Do you have activities that the children can help themselves to? Do you have a table and floor space that children can bring an activity of their choice to? You can also use this as an opportunity to encourage appropriate responsibility, by encouraging children to put one activity away before selecting another.  </p>
            </div>     

          ##Reinforce individual characteristics

          When children see images they can relate to, such as someone who wears glasses like they do, or someone wearing familiar traditional dress, it can help them feel important and valued. 
          
          When children see images of people they can relate to being healthy and successful, they will believe that they can be healthy and successful too.

            <p class="govuk-body">In your setting, reinforce these ideas through books, display boards, activity materials, role play and educational visits.</p>
            
            <p class="govuk-body">Long term planning will support you to ensure that a wide range of cultural, religious and diverse themes and activities can be incorporated into the setting. Encouraging the children to bring items from home to create displays on a given theme will support the creation of a diverse environment, and will support children’s confidence and communication skills. </p>
            </div>   

          ##Social stories

          Social stories are a set of instructions, supported by visual clues, to help children remember how to navigate social situations and changes in routine.

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Work with children to create their own social stories. You can encourage them to draw or stick visual reminders to create a social story which will help them follow daily routines within the setting. You can also involve children in creating social stories for non routine changes, like:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>moving house </li>
              <li>welcoming a new sibling </li>
              <li>going to a doctor's appointment </li>
              <li>navigating illness or death</li>
            </ul> 
            </div>          

          ##Encourage responsibility
          ![A young child choosing a book from a bookshelf in an early years setting.](/assets/3-1-2-1-1161936935.jpg)

          Giving children responsibility that is appropriate to their stage of development will support them to develop a wealth of skills. For younger children, this may start with something as simple as a choice of toy, or the decision of which story to read. 
          
          For toddlers, it could include encouraging them to return their own plates and cups at mealtimes and actively engage in tidying up. 
          
          At around the age of 4, children can take part in a wider variety of tasks, including serving themselves, dressing themselves and keeping their activity area tidy.
          
          Encouraging children to take responsibility will promote self-worth, self-efficacy and self-esteem.

            <p class="govuk-body">Are all children given stage appropriate responsibilities? If not, why not?</p>
          </div>

          ##Include children's preferences

          When a child can see that their individual interests and needs have been taken into account, their learning will be more effective. The obvious reason for this is that children will be more engaged because it is something of interest to them. However, children will also feel important and valued because you have taken their individuality into consideration. This will result in more conversation, and therefore more opportunities to develop their communication skills. 
          
          Children will feel more confident to discuss topics they feel more knowledgeable about. This is a good opportunity for you to encourage the use of questioning and to introduce new vocabulary.

          Excluding children from the strategies we’ve just discussed can be very harmful to their development.
          
          Perseverance may be needed with children who are not familiar with the expectations of choice and responsibility. You should work with parents and carers to support their understanding of your strategies and to encourage consistency.
          
          Children should not be overlooked when assigning responsibilities just because the responsibility is considered to be difficult. This is where learning can be scaffolded, often by another child, or tasks can be simplified. No child should be considered as low ability, and often appropriate responsibility will support the confidence needed to boost other areas of development.
          
          It is important that the responsibilities you offer are gender neutral to support inclusion and unbiased views.

        heading: Developing views 
        body: |
          Children are not born with preformed views of others around them. As they develop their knowledge and understanding of the world, they will use their experiences with others and the environments they access to shape their views and opinions. Along with parents and carers, as a practitioner you will play a significant role in shaping children’s views. 
          
          Children will notice difference and can easily develop misconceptions. However, they will not naturally hold stereotypical assumptions or be biased. It is important that children’s misconceptions are not dismissed or ignored, and that they do not result in negative consequences. Instead, you should take misconceptions as an opportunity to encourage children to test their thoughts, become curious and develop well rounded knowledge that is supported by a wealth of information. 
          
          Children can become influenced by any exposure to bias and stereotypes from as early as 3 years old. 
          
          For example, research suggests that when children hear statements such as “girls are good at drawing”, they conclude that this means that boys are not good at drawing, and can therefore become unintentionally biased.
          
          It is important that children experience activities and opportunities that are rich in diversity, ensuring that they are given the opportunity to explore a broad variety of roles, cultures, characteristics and resources in an unbiased way. This will ensure that they have the knowledge and skills to live successfully in a diverse world.

          ![A young boy playing with a toy kitchen.](/assets/3-1-2-3a-1242974033.jpg)
          
          Encourage children to be curious and let them know it’s OK to ask. Be prepared to give them balanced responses that consider questions from multiple perspectives, and which encourage them to develop their own informed conclusions and views. 

          Ideally children will see positive views of the world both at home and in the setting. However, depending on the other significant roles in the child’s life, this might not always be the case. Children may see or hear views in the media or in their homes that may differ from the setting, and may test them within the setting. It is important that you do not simply dismiss the ideas, but instead provide children with opportunities to explore and test their understanding and make an informed conclusion. 
          
          Adult led activity to support children’s exploration of views can include creating an environment that: 

          - encourages children to discuss their perceptions of culture, race and gender
          - supports children to share their experiences and encourage others to ask questions
          - encourages empathy through imaginative play, positive relationships and role modelling care and compassion
          - celebrates diversity with resources, displays, activities and visitors
          - encourages curiosity and exploration through handling unfamiliar items, experiencing unfamiliar foods and learning about new places

        body: |
          When children are not able to understand and process their feelings and thoughts they can become frustrated. This can then display itself as unwanted or challenging behaviour.
          
          This can become even more difficult if children also do not have the language skills needed to be able to communicate their needs and feelings successfully. 
          
          A lack of communication skills could be a result of: 
          
          - undiagnosed hearing impairments
          - limited or negative previous experiences
          - a lack of confidence in social situations
          
          Supporting children with consistent boundaries and expectations, whilst promoting development in an enabling environment, will help them develop into thoughtful children who are able to consider the consequences of their actions.

        heading: Influences on behaviour
        body: |
          ![A young child sat playing on the floor, supported by a practitioner.](/assets/3-1-3-1a-817588588.jpg)
          
          If you think about the things that influence your behaviour, it won’t be very different for children. What can be more difficult for children is the ability to understand what they are feeling. The frustration, confusion and worries associated with this can be displayed as challenging or unwanted behaviour.
          
          It is essential that you identify the cause of such behaviour to enable you to support children’s development.
          
          Children’s language and communication skills will play a significant role in how they manage their behaviour. If children are not able to express their wishes, they may become frustrated with the outcome of a situation. If a child does not have the vocabulary or skills to explain how they are feeling, they will still need to find a way to express themselves.
          
          It is essential that you support children to understand their behaviour, including the causes and impacts, to avoid increasing their frustrations.
          
          Before we consider the practitioner’s role in more detail, let’s identify the potential influences. 

          ##Meeting children’s needs
          
          We have previously looked at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which identifies the importance of meeting a child’s physiological and safety needs.
          
          It is important to ensure you are meeting these needs to avoid potentially challenging behaviour that can occur if a child is tired, hungry, cold or worried. 

          ##Overstimulation or understimulation 
          
          When children become overstimulated by things in their environment, like noise, light, or crowds, their responses may be interpreted as challenging or unwanted behaviour.
          
          When children become overstimulated they might:
          
          - refuse to carry out simple tasks that you know they are capable of
          - cry or shout
          - show tantrum-like behaviours, including hitting out 
          
          In your setting, children will benefit from a designated quiet area that they know they can retreat to if things become too much. A knowledge of children’s interests can also be helpful here, as they can be used as a distraction. 
          
          Children who are understimulated will become bored and try to entertain themselves in other ways, which may present as challenging or unwanted behaviour. Using your knowledge of child development and of the individual child, you can tailor your setting to engage and challenge each child.
          
          ##The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
          
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children will have experienced inconsistent routines, boundaries and unpredictability. For some children, this has resulted in increased worries and anxiety. These experiences may lead to challenging behaviour in a number of ways. Children who struggle to conform to new expectations, such as daily routines, may become angry or frustrated as they struggle to understand the need for change. 
          
          Children who are anxious and worried may struggle to settle, concentrate or engage, which may present itself as challenging behaviour. They will need reassurance, additional explanation and repetition to support the adjustment. 
          
          Working in partnership with parents will support you to further understand the children’s experiences and will enable you to incorporate familiar items and routines where possible.

          ##Development challenges 

          If a task or experience is too difficult, children may present challenging behaviour to prevent others finding out that they do not understand. If children do attempt the task, they may become frustrated or upset when they are not able to understand or complete it.

          ##Changes in daily routines
          
          A lack of routine can leave children feeling unsafe as they struggle to manage the unpredictability. Children who feel insecure or worried may express their feelings through challenging or unwanted behaviour. This is even more likely if the child does not have the appropriate communication skills to share their concerns verbally. 
          
          Expecting a child to conform to a new routine with little warning or explanation will also impact on their behaviour. If the child has not experienced routine at home, or if the new routine is vastly different, the child may resist the change. This resistance may present itself as challenging or unwanted behaviour. 
          
          A transition will create a change in routine. Moving house, welcoming a new baby or a divorce will all potentially leave children feeling unsettled. Being excited, nervous or worried can all present as challenging or unwanted behaviour.

          As well as supporting children’s communication skills, you can use a wide variety of strategies to promote positive behaviour.
          
          ##Consistent expectations and boundaries 
          
          If we have high expectations of children’s behaviour, our everyday routines and behaviours will instill the same expectations in the children. Within your setting, many of these expectations and boundaries will be set by the policies and procedures in place.
          
          In addition to this, you will need to be a good role model and have realistic expectations in relation to the child’s level of understanding and stage of development.                    
          
          It is also important to remember that children who meet our expectations still require continual recognition. If a child only gets acknowledgement when they are behaving in a challenging manner, they will continue to behave in this way to receive our attention.
          
          Having high expectations will also result in consistent boundaries. When children know how adults will respond to them, they will tailor their behaviour to receive the response they like the most. Taking the opportunity to recognise and praise appropriate behaviour will encourage children to repeat this behaviour. Setting simple stage appropriate rules, and reinforcing expectations like having kind hands or not running indoors, can be the start of teaching children to meet expectations. 
          
          If we have low or inconsistent expectations, children will become confused or frustrated. This can then result in challenging or unwanted behaviour. 
          
          The challenge may come when different significant individuals in the child’s life have different expectations. In your setting, policies, procedures and staff development will create and support a consistent environment. Encouraging positive relationships with parents and carers can help build consistency.

          ##Access to outdoor environments
          
          We have previously discussed how children can feel a greater sense of freedom outdoors, and how this can allow them to explore their feelings or frustrations before they present as challenging behaviour.
          
          ##Understanding of consequences
          
          Helping children to understand the consequences of their actions will support them to manage their behaviour.
          
          For example, if a child understands that their actions have hurt their friend, or broken something, this may help to deter them from repeating those actions. 
          
          Consequences can be another deterrent for children – for example, having to sit out of an activity for 5 minutes, or not being able to play with the toy they have fought over.

          ##Between the ages of 18 to 36 months  
          
          At this age, you will need to use redirection strategies to shape and guide a child’s behaviour. For example, instead of telling a child "don’t shout", you could say "can we talk quietly please? Your friends are sleeping". This is because asking the child not to shout does not guide them to the behaviour you are looking for, or explain why you need them to behave differently.
          
          This redirection strategy can apply to all aspects of behaviour. If children are arguing over toys, find a substitute or agree a time period before swapping. If a child is using equipment in a dangerous way, explain that they could hurt themselves and show them how to use it safely.

          ##Between 3.5 to 5 years 
          
          At this age, children need clear rules and directions. 
          
          Avoid overcomplicating instructions, as this may lead to confusion and frustration which results in unwanted behaviour. When children need to make a good decision, offer limited choices.
          
          Children of this age will continue to need quiet time, both to avoid overstimulation and to offer opportunities for them to reflect on situations and work through their feelings. Sending children to a quiet spot for a set amount of time is also a good response to unwanted behaviour. 
          
          Appropriate praise when a child is behaving in the way you want will boost their confidence and remind them that they are meeting your expectations.

          The very early relationships children experience, usually with their parents, will shape the way that they develop and maintain later relationships.
          
          Research shows that children who experience healthy, trusting relationships are:  
          
          - less likely to be affected by stress
          - able to cope well with change
          - more easily able to manage their emotions and behaviour 
          - often more confident, due to having stronger self identity 
          - less likely to experience depression in later life 
          
          Understanding how to build and strengthen relationships in the early years will ensure you are able to effectively support children’s development.

        body: |
          Over the coming pages we will consider a range of theories regarding how children may build and secure relationships.

          As discussed earlier, it’s important to remember that theory is just that - theoretical ideas based on the research of individuals. Some theories were first published a number of years ago and will have been supported or criticised by more recent research. 

          Just as no single activity will suit the needs of all children, no single theory will influence how you support a child.
          
          The information we consider will support your knowledge about how children develop positive attachments and how you can support them effectively.

        heading: John Bowlby’s theory of attachment
        body: |
          John Bowlby (1907 to 1990) was a British psychologist who believed that the attachments experienced in early childhood would play an influential role in children’s development, mental health and wellbeing.
          
          Bowlby believed that children are born with an innate drive to form relationships, and are therefore pre-programmed to form attachments.
          
          Bowlby suggested that: 
          
          - babies needed to form a strong attachment in the first year of life, normally with their mother
          - babies would be at risk of developing cognitive issues if this significant attachment did not occur 
          - cognitive issues could also occur if babies experienced prolonged separation in the first four years of life
          - babies and young children would experience anxiety if separated from their most significant attachment
          
          Bowlby identified 3 stage of separation anxiety. 
          
          In the first stage, protest, children may scream, kick, show anger and try to escape. 
          
          During the second stage, despair, it may seem as though children have accepted the separation. However, they will appear withdrawn and may display self-soothing techniques. 
          
          In the third and final stage, detachment, children may lose their trust in people. Bowlby suggested that this stage will apply when children are separated from their most significant attachment for a longer period of time.

        heading: Mary Ainsworth’s theory of attachment
        body: |
          Mary Ainsworth (1913 to 1999) was an American Canadian developmental psychologist. Ainsworth built upon Bowlby’s previous work.

          Ainsworth too acknowledged the importance of a significant attachment, but also wanted to investigate the quality of the attachment.
          
          To do this, she conducted her “strange situation” experiment.
          
          The experiment starts with both parent and baby entering a room, where the baby is able to explore. Next, a stranger joins the room and then the parent leaves. After a short period, the parent returns and settles the child while the stranger leaves. The baby is then left alone in the room for a short period before the stranger returns to interact with the baby. Finally, the parent returns and the stranger leaves.
          
          At every stage the babies’ reactions were observed to determine their level of distress and how easily they could be comforted.
          
          As a result of the experiment Ainsworth categorised attachment into 3 types: secure attachment, insecure avoidant attachment, and insecure ambivalent attachment.
          
          Ainsworth concluded that the quality of the attachment would differ between children as a result of the care received. 
          
          Later research also resulted in a fourth attachment style, known as disorganised controlling attachment.

        body: |
          ##Secure attachment 
          
          This type of attachment suggests that a warm and loving relationship with a significant adult has been experienced from an early age.
          
          Usually, adults who experienced this is in childhood are equipped to build healthy relationships in the future.
          
          There are many benefits for children who are able to form secure attachments, including:
          
          - greater resilience 
          - the ability to build strong social relationships
          - learning and developing with ease 

          ##Insecure avoidant attachment
          
          This attachment style typically forms in the first 18 months of life. Individuals in this category did not learn that the adult’s role was to care for them. This could have been as a result of trauma or emotionless care. A significant role model may have unintentionally taught the child that it is not good to be emotional. The caring style will have been very practical. The child will develop self-reliance and conclude that other people are not able to help them. 
          
          Children who have experienced this early attachment style will most likely:
          
          - be anxious to please 
          - be anxious that others are not able to keep them safe
          - feel rejected
          - struggle to connect with others 

          ##Insecure ambivalent attachment
          
          This type of attachment is also known as anxious attachment. Children develop this attachment style when they cannot predict the response they will receive from an adult. This may be as a result of inconsistent care, resulting in unpredictability and a lack of trust. The significant adult role in the child’s life may have easily swung between kindness and reward and punishment, with no sense of reason for the child. 
          
          Children who have experienced this type of attachment may:
          
          - continuously seek approval
          - have a fear of being abandoned 
          - cling to the parent or carer
          - lack the security to settle into learning 
          
          Older children may:
          
          - have limited friendships
          - be anxious about what others think of them 
          - be constantly focused on the negative and try to avoid tasks
          - demand the practitioner’s attention 
          - have poor concentration 

          ##Disorganised controlling attachment
          
          This type of attachment often develops as a result of a significant role model becoming a source of fear, instead of the expected source of safety.
          
          This may be due to a traumatic experience, or unreliable and unpredictable behaviour. The child’s relationships and environments may be chaotic and erratic.
          
          Children with disorganised attachment: 
          
          - have difficulty trusting others
          - appear to prefer to be alone
          - are more prone to stress 
          - have difficulty regulating negative emotions
          - have low self-esteem
          - have poor social skills

          Older children may:
          
          - try to take on the parental role and act as the caregiver to their parent and others
          - refuse to engage in work 
          - try to create chaotic environments

          When children experience anything other than a secure attachment, they will need many of the same support strategies that all children need, but with more emphasis placed in certain areas.
          
          ##Maintain predictable routines
          
          Children without a secure attachment style may not instinctively rely on adults, and inconsistent routines or unpredictability will make the development of this reliance even more difficult. 
          
          ##Emotional age
          
          You will need to offer the correct support and learning experiences for the child’s current stage of emotional development, rather than the level you might expect them to be at for their age.
          
          ##Name feelings
          
          You should support children to develop an ability to express how they feel and the reasons for their feelings.
          
          ##Timely support 
          
          If you have had to put consequences in place as a result of challenging behaviour, be sure that relatively quickly afterwards the child knows that you are still there to support them. Where children have not been used to set expectations, consequences can be very unsettling and may impact on any progress made.

            <p class="govuk-body">To support children, you can: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>use stories, discussions, puppets, role play and questioning to help them name and manage their feelings and anxieties </li>
              <li>involve them in discussions about changes in routine, and use visual aids as regular reminders of the new routine </li>
              <li>offer regular reassurance and praise  </li>
              <li>explain why you have set consequences for their actions as soon as the actions have occurred, to ensure they know that the incident has been dealt with and that they do not need to dwell on it  </li>
            </ul> 
            </div>   

          ##Have realistic expectations 
            
          Children may take small steps towards building trust, self-esteem and confidence. Celebrate each small step so the child’s progress can be acknowledged. This will help them to feel valued and important. 
            
          ##Set boundaries
            
          When children are struggling in any area, it may be tempting to relax boundaries or expectations to show care and support. In fact, children need the opposite. They need their environment and significant adults to be predictable and reliable to help them build trust.
            
          ##Encourage peer relationships
            
          Positive peer relationships can support the development of self-esteem, which can also aid development of self-worth. Peer relationships can also help children to explore and understand their feelings and thoughts.

        body: |
          The first relationships children build are with their parents. After building these initial parent-child relationships, they will go on to build further relationships with others through a process of social referencing. Social referencing is where babies and young children observe and mimic their parents' reactions to meeting new people, and use these reactions to form their own relationships. 
          
          Along with a child’s family, you will be a significant attachment in a child’s life.
          
          As a key person, you will build a relationship with a child’s parents or carers to support their transition, learning and development. Your interaction with a child’s parents or carers will play an important role in your relationship with the child.

          The EYFS requires you to work closely with parents and carers to support positive child development and consistency of care.
          
          As you will be aware, parents and carers are the people who know their child best, and who are most influential in terms of their development.
          
          Parents and carers' knowledge and understanding of their child will help you to care for them. In turn, your expert knowledge will help them to support their child’s development. 
          
          It is therefore essential that you build a trusting and positive relationship with parents and carers. Positive relationships will benefit children in many ways.
          
          ##Increased consistency
          
          An effective partnership between you and a child’s parents or carers will promote trust and increase the chances of them adopting any care and education strategies that you suggest. A parent who trusts you will also share the information you need to help you mimic the child’s home environment and meet their needs.
          
          ##Shared realistic expectations 
          
          When you communicate effectively with parents and carers, everyone caring for the child will have a full understanding of the child’s needs, preferences and level of development. This will support better understanding of both the child’s current skills and the plan to promote progress. When everyone has realistic expectations, the child will have the freedom to learn in supportive environments. 

          ##Support the practitioner child relationship

          When children see that you have a positive relationship with their parents or carers, it builds their trust in you and improves your relationship with them. This will make children feel more safe and secure, and will help them to feel confident and settled within your setting. 

          As they look to you as a role model, children are also likely to copy your behaviour and treat their parents in the same way you do. 

          Knowing about the significant adult roles in a child’s life is important and will support you to help them.

        body: |
          Occasionally, you may face barriers to building positive partnerships with parents and carers that you will need to overcome.
          
          ##Communication barriers 
          
          English may be a second language for the child’s family, or parents and carers may lack confidence with their communication and understanding. You may need to take time to make sure you can provide information in their first language. 
          
          ##Negative experiences
          
          If parents have had their own negative experiences with learning and education, they may be more reluctant to engage in their child’s education and care.
          
          ##Time
          
          Busier lifestyles mean that it may not be parents that drop off and collect children from your setting. As a result, you’ll need to find alternative methods of communication. Potential communication methods could include telephone calls, emails or a message book kept in the child’s bag. 
          
          ##Sharing information 
          
          It is important that you know as much as possible about the children you care for. However, parents or carers may not realise that certain information they have about their child could be valuable to you, or may not want to share this information if it causes them embarrassment. You should encourage them to share everything they know.
          
          ##COVID-19
          
          During the pandemic, the way that children were dropped off and picked up changed. This may have impacted on your opportunities to meet children and parents before they start in your setting. For example, parents or carers may not have given information on a form that would naturally have come up during a settling in visit in your setting. In turn, this will have impacted on what we know about our children and parents.

          Every child in an EYFS environment will be assigned a key person.
          
          As a child’s key person you will ensure they settle into the setting and receive care tailored to their individual needs. 
          
          As part of this role, you will need to:
          
          - support the child to feel emotionally secure when their parents or carers are not there
          - ensure the child feels safe and offer reassurance
          - promote the child’s language development 
          - attend to the child’s personal care needs 
          - develop strong partnerships with the child’s parents or carers
          - complete observation, assessment and planning 
          - promote the child’s independence

          It will be clear that a child has achieved secure relationships when they: 
          
          - seek you out for reassurance if they are worried
          - want to share their success
          - look for comfort when they are tired
          - are able to wait without becoming anxious 
          - are responsive to discipline

        body: |
          By nurturing a secure relationship with children in your care, you can play an influential role in shaping their behaviour. In turn, this will support successful learning and development. 

          As a trusted adult, you will be able to support children to manage their feelings and build the confidence they need to become fully engaged in their learning.

          ##Managing feelings
          
          Children will experience the same feelings as adults, but will not always know what the feeling is or have the vocabulary to express themselves. Supporting children to understand and manage their feelings will help to increase their resilience, raise their self-efficacy and support them to manage their behaviour.
          
          Children who are able to manage their feelings are more likely to experience positive overall mental health and wellbeing. 
          
          ##Help children to name the feeling
          
          Children will not necessarily know that the name for their feeling is nervous, excited, sad, frustrated. In the same way that children need to learn the names for everyday items, they need support to be able to name what they are feeling. Even when children do not have the verbal language to explain their feelings, they will benefit from hearing the associated vocabulary. Right from birth, language such as “are you hungry?” or “are you tired?” can be used to help a baby to understand the feeling they are experiencing. 
          
          As children become older, you should encourage them to consider how situations have made them feel. For example, when a child shares an experience such as getting a new dog or falling down, we can ask them “were you excited?” or “did that make you feel sad?” This can support the child to recognise the emotion they were feeling, and hopefully reduce worry when negative emotions are experienced. 
          
          You can find a link to an activity to help children name emotions in the further activities at the end of the module. 
          
          We have also previously considered how helping children to name their feelings can positively support behaviour management. 
          
          If a child is not yet able to express themselves verbally, you should use alternative methods to help them do so, such as flashcards.
    
          ##Provide opportunities for children to see others expressing feelings 
          
          Children will benefit from reading stories or experiencing opportunities that explore the feelings of others. 
          
          In your setting, these may be structured activities such as those used to explore big changes in a child’s life. For example, when children are learning about moving house, welcoming a new baby or visiting the dentist for the first time, the activity will provide lots of opportunity to discuss the feelings involved. 
          
          You should include all children in these activities, and no feeling should be dismissed as wrong. Instead, children should be encouraged to explain why they might feel that way. 
          
          Children will often use such activities to discuss other situations that have caused similar feelings. These should not be cut short or avoided, as it is important that the child feels heard. These opportunities can also be used to influence future activities around feelings. 
          
          Creative activities, or those that encourage imagination, can also be a good outlet for emotions and provide an opportunity for children to explore their thoughts. There is a link to ideas for activities to communicate through arts in the further activities at the end of this module. 
          
          As well as this, you should identify spontaneous opportunities for children to explore feelings. For example, when dealing with conflict between children, it is important to encourage each child involved to consider how the others may feel. Other spontaneous opportunities may include when a friend hurts themselves, or celebrating a child’s achievement, no matter how small.
          
          Children who understand the feelings of anger, disappointment or frustration are more likely to work to avoid or process them without the need for impulsive behaviour.
          
          Children who recognise their feelings are also likely to be more skilled at self-expression.

          ![A group of young children playing on the floor. One child has turned their head and is expressing their feelings to someone behind the camera.](/assets/3-2-3-2a-637106870.jpg)
          
          Even before children can communicate verbally they will learn to express themselves through non-verbal methods, including facial expressions and body language.

          Just as each child will develop at a different rate, they will also each have their own characteristics and qualities. It’s important that we nurture children’s journey of self-expression and support aspects of their individuality, such as clothing styles, friendship choices and personal interests. 

          Children who do not grow up in an environment full of love, respect and compassion are more likely to struggle with self-expression and experience mental health difficulties in later life. 

          It is important for children to be able to communicate their thoughts and needs without holding back, whilst also being mindful of the impact of their actions.
          
          Children need to be encouraged to communicate honestly to let others know how they feel. In your setting, you should support children to:

          - maintain eye contact 
          - be motivated to ask questions
          - explore their feelings
          - choose items that express their individuality

          Earlier in the module, we established that children with high self-efficacy, self-worth and self-confidence are likely to be more resilient.
          
          These skills also affect how children tackle learning in all other areas of development.
          
          A child who is confident is likely to be more curious, leading them to ask more questions and further deepen their curiosity. In turn, this leads to exploration, and the potential to develop skills in all areas, particularly communication.
          
          A child with high self-efficacy will approach tasks and experiences feeling that they can succeed. This makes them more likely to try challenging tasks which will help them to continually develop. 
          
          A child with strong self-worth will feel valued and important, and will be more likely to engage in conversations and group activities, further promoting their development.

        body: |    
          Children's self-regulation and executive function can impact on all areas of their development. 

          Executive function refers to the skills we need to be able to achieve things, while self-regulation refers to the skills we need to keep our emotions and behaviour stable.   
          
          Children are not born with executive function skills or the ability to self-regulate. They need to learn, develop and practice these skills. 
          
          The environment, experiences and opportunities they are exposed to will influence the level of executive function and self-regulation skills they acquire.

        heading: Why self-regulation is important
        body: |    
          A child’s ability to self-regulate will impact on all areas of development, including: 
          
          - social interactions
          - mental health and wellbeing
          - behaviour management
          - learning and development
          
          We have previously discussed the importance of supporting children to recognise and name their feelings. Now we will consider how we can support children to manage these feelings, and regulate the behaviour that follows.
          
          This topic includes:

          ## Executive function
          Executive function refers to the skills we need to achieve things, like those that support organisation and planning, focussing attention and retaining information. 
          
          ## Self-regulation
          Self-regulation refers to the skills we need to keep our emotions and behaviour stable so that we can achieve things, such as persevering in challenging situations, ignoring distractions and thinking before acting. 
          
          ## Developing self-regulation and executive function skills
          Children are not born with executive function skills or the ability to self-regulate. They need to learn, develop and practice these skills. 
          
          The environment, experiences and opportunities that children are exposed to will influence the level of executive function and self-regulation skills they acquire and develop.
          
          As with other areas of development, children will all develop at their own rate. 
          
          Usually, the skills needed to self-regulate start to develop as a toddler.
          
          At approximately 12 to 18 months old, children begin to develop an awareness of social expectations. They also have the ability to change their behaviour when asked, provided they are clearly directed and supported by an adult. 
          
          By the age of 2, children’s skills have progressed and they are usually able to change their behaviour without close direction. 
          
          By 3 years old, most children can relate situations to previous experiences and manage their reactions.

          Developing self-regulation skills can benefit all areas of development.

          ##Physical benefits
          
          Research shows that the ability to self-regulate can encourage healthy brain development and reduce the likelihood of medical issues like heart disease and obesity. 

          ##Emotional benefits
          
          Being able to self-regulate helps to increase resilience and supports children to cope better with stress. Good self-regulation skills also promote positive mental health and wellbeing.

          ##Social benefits
          
          The ability to self-regulate helps children to make and maintain friendships, as they find it easier to get along with others. Positive relationships and friendships in the learning environment can in turn support children’s development and success in later life.

          If children do not develop effective executive function skills, it can have consequences for all areas of their learning and development.
          
          ##Social consequences
          
          Children with limited executive function may find it difficult to fit in with social norms. They may also struggle to: 
          
          - work in pairs or small groups
          - share resources or environments
          - participate in conversations
          
          ##Learning consequences
          
          Children with limited executive function have difficulty with attention and concentration. This can impact on their ability to learn, as they become easily distracted and struggle to remember key information. Executive function skills will support children to plan and carry out tasks within given timescales. Without these skills, children may not engage in essential child led opportunities, and may also struggle to complete tasks during adult led activities. 

          ##Behavioural consequences 
          
          Children with limited executive function may lack the flexibility to accommodate changes in plans, activities and rules, which in turn may result in frustration. They may give up in the middle of activities, or forget the task directions during an activity. Frustrations may lead to outbursts, which for some children may become physical.

          As a practitioner in the early years, you will work with the children in your care to support the development of their executive function and self-regulation skills.

          This topic includes:

          - Activities to support executive function development

          Developing self-regulation requires guidance and support. As children begin to recognise and name their feelings, they will also need your support to learn to regulate them.

          This support can be referred to as co-regulation, meaning when you work in cooperation with others to develop skills. 

          If children are not effectively supported to understand and regulate their feelings, they can become overwhelmed and struggle with the challenges they experience as part of their daily lives. 

          As a practitioner, you can use both planned and spontaneous opportunities to support self-regulation.

          ##Spontaneous activity 

          In your practice, you will constantly be observing children to support their learning and development. When spontaneous opportunities for learning self-regulation skills arise, such as conflict over a toy, you will need to provide the appropriate support. In this example, you may need to consider whether you should step in straight away to help the children understand how to manage the conflict, or whether you should observe for longer to see if they can resolve the situation for themselves. This will also help you to plan activities to further support the children’s understanding. 

          ##Planned activity 
          
          Adult led planned activities and experiences can be opportunities to ensure that:
          
          - all children are engaged
          - appropriate behaviour can be modelled 
          - boundaries and expectations can be reinforced 


          Examples of planned activities could include:
          
          - shared stories that explore feelings and challenging situations such as conflict, big life changes and individual challenges
          - adult led imaginative play, including puppets and role play, followed by child led opportunities
          - adult led creative activities, including art, music, dance and drama – these activities can then be further supported by child led opportunities

          It is essential for children to have a safe environment to trial their self-regulation skills.

          Children will also need clear boundaries and predictable responses to ensure they understand what is expected of them. This will require you to work in partnership with parents and carers to support consistent messages and care. 

          You should also acknowledge children’s self-regulation attempts, even when they are not fully successful. This will help children to realise that their attempts have been recognised, which will encourage further development. 

          It is important to have patience and remain calm while children develop their self-regulation skills. Remember that children will take your lead on how to behave in a situation.

          In your setting, you can implement routines and activities to support the development of children’s executive function. 
          
          ##Time management 
          
          Using strategies to encourage children’s understanding of time and routine will support them to develop planning and organisation skills. Strategies could include:
          
          - following a daily routine with visual clue reminders
          - having a nursery calendar showing special events
          - using timers for activities or tidying up 
          - singing songs and rhymes about the days of the week or the time of year 
          
          ##Learning recaps 
          
          You can help children to recall information and organise their thoughts by briefly recapping learning from a previous day or session.
          
          ##Visual clues 
          
          Visual step by step instructions can help support children to complete everyday routines and tasks, such as tidying up. Being able to follow visual instructions will reduce anxieties and increase effectiveness, which will result in higher self-esteem and self-worth for the child. You could gradually reduce the number of instructions as the child becomes more confident.
          
          ##Initiating tasks
          
          It is important to teach children to take action. If children are always led, they will not have the opportunity to consider how to start a task or idea for themselves. Ensure that children have frequent opportunity to explore freely, with child led activities to encourage their ability to initiate and carry out activities independently. This will result in improved planning and organisation skills and a greater sense of achievement, supporting improved self-efficacy.

          As early years practitioners, the activities and strategies you use in your setting can play an important role in promoting and building children’s self-regulation skills. 
          
          ##Self-control activities
          
          Jenga and musical statues are examples of activities that require children to show impulse control, flexible thinking and forward thinking. Games that have a winner also require children to regulate their feelings if they are unsuccessful. 
          
          ##Visual reminders 
          
          Children who struggle to self-regulate may need reminders of how to respond to their triggers. For example, a child may call out every time they have a thought as they struggle to control their impulse to share the information. A visual reminder to put up their hand and wait, or write their thought down until a more appropriate moment, will support the child to remember the appropriate behaviour for the situation. 
          
          ##Quiet activities
          
          All children need opportunities to access quieter areas and take time to rest and process their thoughts. This is even more important for children who are still developing their skills or having difficulting self-regulating. Encourage children to think of the quiet area as a calming, safe space. Older children will become aware that they can move to this space, and eventually work towards moving there before their behaviour becomes uncontrolled.
          
          ##Instilling positive habits 
          
          We have previously discussed the importance of good nutrition and sufficient exercise for brain development. This also applies to executive function and self-regulation. Being a good role model for the children will help them understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle. 
          
          As a positive role model, you will:
          
          - remain calm in potentially stressful situations 
          - effectively communicate your feelings, for example by saying “I am disappointed because…” or “This has made me sad because…”
          - show resilience by persisting when you find something difficult
          - show the ability to be flexible 

          ##Social stories
          
          Social stories are a set of instructions, supported by visual clues, to help children remember how to navigate social situations and changes in routine. 
          
          ##Movement breaks 
          
          Proprioceptive activities, which are weight bearing activities like walking, crawling and running, can help to calm sensory overload and support children to focus. All children benefit from movement breaks, but they are especially important for those who have difficulty with impulse control and emotional response. 
          
          ##Mindfulness 
          
          Calming activities, like breathing exercises, yoga and meditation, can also help children to increase focus, reduce stress and support their ability to resolve conflict.
          
          ##Imaginative play 
          
          Imaginative play, like role play, can support children to explore their feelings and test responses in a safe space. You can also use adult led role play to model appropriate behaviour and support children’s understanding of boundaries and expectations.

          Language and communication skills underpin all other areas of development, including mastering the skill of self-regulation.
          
          Language is a socially acceptable way of expressing ourselves. When children do not have these language skills, or are frustrated because they can not make themselves understood, it may make it more difficult for them to regulate their responses to challenging situations.
          
          Usually as children’s language skills develop, episodes of challenging behaviour decrease. Their growing understanding of receptive language, which is their understanding of written and spoken language, improves their ability to understand situations from another perspective. The development of their expressive language, which is their ability to express themselves through speech and other appropriate forms of communication, helps them to share their needs.
          
          Research shows that children with higher levels of expressive language develop self-regulation faster.
      3-recap:
        heading: Recap
        body: |    
          Every child will develop at their own individual rate and will experience a wide variety of influences that could potentially impact upon their social and emotional development. 
          
          Your role is to support the development of key skills and minimise negative influences and their potential impact. This will ensure that children are supported to approach life with resilience. It will also help them to tackle challenges with high self-efficacy, as a result of feeling valued and important. 
          
          Promoting and role modelling healthy and secure relationships is crucial to supporting children’s development. Doing so will ensure that children are equipped to build and maintain successful relationships throughout childhood and later life.
          
          Supporting children to successfully self-regulate will impact positively on all areas of their development, including social interactions, mental health and wellbeing, behaviour management and learning and development.
          
          Without knowledge of the expected stages of development and knowledge of each individual child in your care, it will be difficult to provide the correct environment necessary for their success.
