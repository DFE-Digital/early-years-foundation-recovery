          ##Why markdown is important

          Understanding markdown is critical to being able to use the CMS. Markdown users feel a range of user needs, but cannot express them unless they know how to format them in markdown. Being able to use **bold text** may help.

          With poor markdown skills, it could be harder for CMS users to create:

          - bullet points
          - more bullet points
          - even more bullet points

          It may be even more difficult for them to create:

          1. numbered lists
          2. like
          3. this

          You’ll need:

          - a way to write markdown
          - a CMS

          CMS users can learn how best to express their emotions [(using inline links)](/understanding-the-world), and define what each emotion means for them [(sense of self)](/personal-social-and-emotional-development/sense-of-self).

          ##Quotes using information callouts

          ^“Markdown users can use information callouts, which lets them share their thoughts and feelings with confidence. They are encouraged to build on emotional knowledge - receiving time, attention and comfort by caregivers, and feeling heard.”^
