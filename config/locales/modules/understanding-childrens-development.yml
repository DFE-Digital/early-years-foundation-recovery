          Welcome to the “Understanding Child Development” Course.

          On completion of this course you will be able to:

            - explain the importance of early childhood education and care
            - explore the importance of child development knowledge
            - evaluate effective delivery of the EYFS
            - evaluate the impact of contributing factors on all aspects of children’s development
            - review strategies used to provide a positive approach to early childhood education and care

          By becoming an Early Years Practitioner you have committed to the most important role of supporting learning and development in the most crucial period of a child’s learning journey. 

          Every child is unique and whilst almost all children will experience the same pattern of development they will almost certainly develop at differing rates and face different challenges within their unique journey. As a practitioner the choices you make and the curriculum you offer will play a vital role in ensuring that all children have opportunity to reach their full potential.

          Having robust knowledge and understanding of child development will support your professional judgment and enable you to successfully and effectively meet the needs of all the children in your care. 

          As an aspirational role model within the early years it is essential that you secure, continually develop and utilise this knowledge and understanding of children’s development to support you to approach your role with a curiosity about what the right high quality care looks like for each and every individual child at every stage of development.
