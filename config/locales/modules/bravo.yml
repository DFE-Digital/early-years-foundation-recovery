        heading: Which environment do I use?
        body: |
          Content changes should be made in `master` which is a special environment alias in Contentful.
          The `master` alias points to content in another environment, currently called `production`.

          `master` > `production`

          The `master` environment has access to all settings, where as others are limited:

          The `master` environment also includes a version history of content entry edits:

        heading: How to preview
        body: |
          Once a change to content has been made in `master` and autosaved, which happens after a second of inactivity,
          a webhook is triggered that alerts the `staging` application of new content.

          In the web app, on the right-hand side, is a preview button with one of three options.

          Change your preview button to `staging` if you haven't already done so, and the "preview" button
          will take yo to the current page as found in the `staging` deployment. You will need to be logged in to see this.

          The other options are `dev` and `local` which target the `dev` deployment and websites running on a developer's machine
          respectively.

      1-1-3:
        heading: Why is there a delay?
        body: |
          As covered in the first module, our application is currently using in meomry caching to reduce latency.

          This may be changed in future iterations but the use of caching speeds up page loading.
          The first time content is loaded after an autosave will be slower whilst linked content is recached.

        body: |
          In `staging` a module overview page will render a box if the module being created
          is found to have not satisfied minimum requirements.

          If the Contentful web app validations for each model are not met, the overview page
          may not be able to render, and the error triage box may not be visible.

          The overview page is similar to `/modules/module-x`
