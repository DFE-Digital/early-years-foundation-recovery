=======
          Every child will develop at their own individual rate and will experience a wide variety of influences that could potentially impact upon their brain development.

          Your role is to promote positive development and minimise negative influences and their potential impact.

          It will be common for children to experience periods where they require support to meet their expected milestones. It is important that you are able to identify where support is needed to prevent potential gaps in learning from occurring or widening further.

          It is important to continually develop your knowledge of the differing theories and concepts surrounding how children learn. This will support you to identify new and applicable strategies to support the children in your care. Not every theory or concept will apply, however this new knowledge will support you to renew and shape your approach as needed.

          Promoting and role modelling healthy lifestyles is crucial to support children and their wider families to understand the associated benefits for development.

          Without knowledge of the expected stages of development and knowledge of your individual children, it will be difficult to provide the correct environment necessary for success.
