      1-1:
        heading: Publishing content changes
        body: |
          This module covers how to make content changes public.
      1-1-1:
        heading: The Launch app
        body: |
          Contentful provides a dedicate application called "Launch" to help facilitate
          releasing multiple changes at once. A "release" is a collection of edits
          that can be grouped together and published at the same time.

          [Launch](https://foo)

          Releases can also be scheduled to go live automatically at a specific time.
      1-1-2:
        heading: What are the benefits?
        body: |
          Using a "release" to organise changes helps the content team keep track of
          edits across multiple modules and better plan when they are published.

          It also enables a better quality assurance process by providing colleagues
          with an overview of related changes in a way that is easier to check.
      1-1-3:
        heading: What about content that is not in a module?
        body: |
          The dev team have made it possible to publish stand-alone or "static" pages
          without the need to use Launch. This is something that might change if the
          benefit does not out weigh the risk.
      1-1-4:
        heading: How does publishing work?
        body: |
          When a release is executed a "webhook" is fired.
