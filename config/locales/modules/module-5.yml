          Developing physical skills
        body: |
          Babies and children will grow rapidly in the early years. It is important that you understand children’s expected physical development so that you are able to support each child appropriately.

          The first section of this module includes:

          - types of physical development
          - stages of physical development
          - theories and approaches relating to physical development
          - factors affecting physical development

          This module does not cover factors such as special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in relation to physical development. This will be covered in a future module.

          Children’s physical development is the growth of the body and brain from birth until they become young adults.

          Physical skills and confidence support children in a vast range of ways, including to:

          - build the foundation for developing social and emotional wellbeing
          - master control of their body by developing core strength, stability, balance, spatial awareness, co-ordination and agility
          - move safely and confidently
          - build healthy habits for their childhood and adult life
          - develop across all areas of learning

          A child’s level of physical development will affect their experiences of the curriculum you set and how you deliver it. This includes how much adult led teaching, adult guided activity, and child led discovery they may benefit from as an individual. Well-developed physical skills and increased independence will help children to move around, handle objects and make independent decisions.

          Children’s physical experiences outside of your setting will vary. It is important to remember that children have different starting points and develop at their own individual rates.

          $INFO

          As a practitioner you have an important role in children’s physical development, including:

          - planning an ambitious and active curriculum
          - providing children with plentiful and age-appropriate active play and exercise
          - providing time outdoors every day (apart from in unsafe weather conditions)
          - adapting to meet the needs of individual children
          - being a good role model
          - building warm, loving, and trusting relationships with the children in your care
          - creating an enabling environment that supports physical development and provides enough space
          - ensuring food and drink you provide is healthy and nutritious
          - encouraging parents to continue active opportunities at home

        heading: |
          Gross and fine motor skills
        body: |
          Developing both fine and gross motor skills will support children’s increasing independence.

          ##Gross motor skills

          Gross motor skills are skills that children develop using their whole body.

          Examples of gross motor skills for babies include:

          - kicking their legs
          - waving their arms
          - rolling
          - reaching

          For older children these skills could include:

          - walking
          - jumping
          - climbing

          ##Fine motor skills

          Fine motor skills involve small muscles working with the brain and nervous system to control movements in areas such as the hands, fingers, lips, tongue and eyes.

          Fine motor control and precision can help to develop hand-eye co-ordination and are linked to success with early literacy skills.

          Examples of fine motor skills for babies include:

          - using their fingers and thumbs to pick things up
          - shaking musical instruments
          - exploring different fabrics
          - feeling and tasting objects and food with their mouth and lips

          For older children these skills could include:

          - grasping
          - cutting
          - threading
          - controlling an object with their hands and fingers

      5-1-1a-3:
        heading: |
          Fundamental movement skills
        body: |
          ![A child reaching for hanging bars](/assets/5-1-1-1-945230780.jpg)

          Fundamental movement skills allow children to coordinate the movement of their feet, legs, trunk, arms and hands.

          Ofsted define fundamental movement skills as: “basic learned motor patterns that do not occur naturally such as catching and balancing.”

          There are positive links between children developing fundamental movement skills and their confidence, cognitive development and communication.

          There are three categories of fundamental movement skills:

          - manipulation skills, which allow us to control objects - for example throwing, catching, striking and bouncing
          - locomotor skills, which include running, hopping, skipping, dodging, leaping, galloping, twisting and dodging
          - stability skills, which are needed to control our body - for example stopping, stretching, landing, twisting and climbing

          These fundamental movement skills will be best developed from the age of 3, but the foundations for these skills are built from birth.

          Ofsted research from 2022 shows that children are entering reception with lower levels of fundamental movement skills. This may be due to a decline in exercise and activity which for some children may be being replaced by screen time or less physical activities.

          $INFO

          You should give young children lots of opportunities to develop gross and fine motor skills. These will provide the foundation for fundamental movement skills.

      5-1-1a-4:
        heading: |
          The vestibular system
        body: |
          The vestibular system is found in the inner ear and develops when babies are in the womb.

          The vestibular system sends messages to the brain to help the body to understand information about its position. Messages can include how fast the body is travelling, how close it is to something and which direction it is travelling in. Its very first job is to turn the baby’s head into the correct position ready for birth.

          The vestibular system also supports the body’s ability to balance and co-ordinate movements. This means that it also affects whether babies and children feel safe while moving around.

          If the vestibular system is underdeveloped or delayed, you may notice that babies and children:

          - appear to struggle with co-ordination, dropping things or falling over more often than other children
          - have trouble concentrating
          - are delayed in meeting developmental milestones
          - appear afraid of moving around such as learning to crawl, stand or walk as they feel unbalanced
          - dislike having their head tilted backwards

          The vestibular system supports children in everyday activities.

          ##Self-care routines

          Children will need to be able to co-ordinate their movements to be able to brush their teeth, feed themselves and fasten clothes with buttons and zips.

          They will also need to be able to balance while dressing, for example needing to stand on one leg while putting the other into trousers or a skirt. If the body starts to wobble the vestibular system sends a message to the brain to help the body stay balanced.

          ##Playing and learning

          Children will need their co-ordination and balancing skills to make sure they are able to reach to pick up items or take part in activities that include stacking, sorting and handling items.

          An underdeveloped vestibular system could also impact on all aspects of gross motor movement from walking and skipping to riding a bike or climbing a slide.

          ##Self-regulation

          The vestibular system is also referred to as the volume control of our senses. This means that it can control how overstimulated children become to other senses and sensations.

          A well-developed system will support children to manage their reactions. Developing self-regulation takes time and enables children to understand and manage their emotions. Over time this helps them begin to regulate their behaviour. A well-developed system will also help children to remain focussed which will help them to concentrate, take part in learning and have the satisfaction of completing tasks.

          $INFO

          You can promote development of the vestibular system by providing opportunities for babies and young children to practise co-ordination and experience movement. This can naturally happen as babies and children travel between and complete activities and have access to outdoor learning and play.

          For babies this could include:

          - opportunities to lie on a blanket or mat to allow for reaching, grasping and rolling
          - supporting and encouraging opportunities to sit, crawl, stand and walk
          - items for babies to grasp and handle such as books, instruments or everyday items like plastic spoons
          - singing and moving to music

          For toddlers and older children this could include:

          - items to stack
          - singing and or music to move to
          - balance activities such as standing on one leg or completing obstacle courses
          - sliding on a slide whilst sitting upright
          - learning to skip, hop, jump
          - learning to use a bike or scooter

          How physical development combines with other skills to support independence
        body: |
          The various aspects of physical development combine to support the skills and ablities that children learn in the early years. Other factors, especially from across the prime areas of learning in the EYFS, also play a role.

          Taking toileting as an example, there are various component skills and knowledge that children need to gain and practise before they can manage toileting independently.

          Different children will show signs of readiness at different times. Parents and carers, and other adults will need to help children understand all the elements of the proccess so that children can gradually learn this important aspect of self-management.

          When a child has learned this, we may expect to see them using the following abilities.

          As children's bodies and brains develop, they will come to know the physical feelings in their bodies that tell them that they need to go to the toilet.

          They will be confident in responding to what their body is telling them.

          They will use gross motor skills to travel to the bathroom and to manoeuvre into position.

          Their fine motor skills will help them to manage zips or buttons, to wipe, and to wash their hands.

          As they learn more about self-management, they will come to understand the importance of washing their hands thoroughly every time.

          They will rely on communication skills, language and vocabulary to tell adults what they are doing, and to ask for help with the process if they need it.

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about how physical development combines with other skills.

          Think about an activity a child in your setting may be finding difficult.

          Consider the following questions:

          - What is the overarching aim of the activity?
          - What physical and other skills, knowledge or abilities are involved in the activity?
          - How could you support the child to develop or improve on these?

          Stages of physical development
        body: |
          Babies and children move through typical stages while developing their physical skills.

          However it is important to remember that children develop at different rates.

          Understanding these typical stages will help you to offer high quality care and identify physical needs.

          This topic includes the typical stages of physical development:

          - at birth
          - 0 to 6 months
          - 7 to 12 months
          - 13 to 24 months
          - 25 to 36 months
          - 37 to 48 months

          ![A baby holding on to an adult's finger showing the palmar grasp reflex](/assets/5-1-1-2a-958169622.jpg)

          Babies are born with a set of automatic and involuntary responses known as reflexes. These reflexes happen as a result of the baby being stimulated.

          Reflexes which are usually present at birth include:

          ##Sucking reflex

          The sucking reflex is for feeding. When a baby feels the roof of their mouth being touched, for instance by a bottle teat, their instinctive response will be to suck on it. This reflex develops from week 36 of pregnancy. Unlike other reflexes, it does not disappear as the baby grows.

          ##Rooting reflex

          The rooting reflex works together with the sucking reflex to enable the baby to feed. They use this reflex to locate the nipple or teat. The rooting reflex is the involuntary response to the corner of the mouth being touched. For example, if you stroke a baby’s cheek they will move their head towards the touch. This reflex will usually disappear by 4 months old.

          ##Moro reflex

          This is also known as the startle reflex as it is a baby’s involuntary response to being startled. This could be because of a loud noise, a sensation that they are falling or sudden movements. Babies will throw out their arms and legs before bringing their arms back across their bodies. This reflex will reduce and disappear once the baby's neck muscles are strong enough to support their head. This is usually from around 4 months of age.

          ##Palmar grasp reflex

          This is where a baby’s finger or hand will curl around an item in response to something touching their palm. For example, if you touch a baby’s palm with your finger, they will curl their fingers around and hold onto your finger. This is a sign that the baby’s nervous system is functioning and developing. This reflex will usually disappear by 6 months old.

          ##Stepping reflex

          If a baby is held upright or so their feet are touching a surface, they raise and lower their feet in a walking motion. This is the beginning of leg muscle development and movement skills. This reflex will disappear by 2 to 3 months old. If this reflex is not present at birth it can cause neurological concerns.

          ![A young baby being held by an adult](/assets/5-1-1-3a-625686418.jpg)

          A baby will grow and develop rapidly in the first 6 months of life. Most babies will progress from having no head or body control to being able to sit and interact with objects with control and purpose.

          A baby’s weight will typically double in the first 6 months. They will typically grow 1.5 to 2.5 centimetres in height each month.

          A child of this age will need between 14 to 16 hours of sleep in each 24 hour period. 8 to 10 of these hours will normally occur at night, with the rest taken as naps during the day.

          Some babies are born with teeth. Yet the most common age for teething to start is 6 months, with most babies showing at least their first tooth by 12 months.

          During this period a baby will have been fed exclusively on milk. Weaning is when solid foods are introduced. This usually begins at around 6 months old. You should discuss with parents and carers how they are approaching weaning. You should always ensure your approach in the setting is safe and appropriate for the baby's age and development.

          On the next two pages you will look at how gross and fine motor skills develop from 0 to 6 months.

        body: |
          ![A young baby being held by an adult](/assets/5-1-1-4-874403616.jpg)

          Between 0 and 6 months, most babies' gross motor skills will develop rapidly.

          ##1 month old

          As well as reflexes, other expected gross motor movements at 1 month old include:

          - the baby’s head flopping backwards if unsupported
          - jerky body movements

          ##2 to 4 months old

          By 2 to 4 months old most babies will be able to:

          - make more controlled arm and leg movements
          - lift their heads by 45 degrees during tummy time, with adult supervision
          - maintain greater control of their heads

          ##4 to 6 months old

          By 4 to 6 months old most babies will be able to:

          - balance their head
          - sit with support
          - roll from their back to their front
          - attempt to support their body when placed on their feet
          - make swimming actions when lying on their tummy

          $INFO

          You should provide even very young babies with opportunities to practise and develop gross motor skills. Activities and opportunities that promote gross motor skills will help to develop:

          - core strength
          - stability
          - balance
          - spatial awareness
          - co-ordination
          - agility

          ###Tummy time

          Tummy time is a gross motor activity where babies are placed on their front for short periods of time while they are awake. Tummy time helps babies to strengthen their neck muscles in preparation for sitting and crawling.

          At first this will only be for a few short minutes per day but can be increased to around 30 minutes per day by 6 months. Babies should always be supervised while on their tummies.

          Some babies may seem distressed at first, but they will soon become used to the new position. You can increase the baby’s enjoyment of tummy time by talking and singing to them or by providing things to look at or reach for.

          ![A baby holding its toes with one hand while holding a toy with the other](/assets/5-1-1-5a-172267023.jpg)

          ##0 to 2 months

          For the first two months of life, babies will not realise they have hands or that they are connected to their body. Babies’ hands will remain in tight fists.

          ##2 to 4 months

          By 2 to 4 months most babies will have become more aware of their hands. They will start to develop their hand-eye co-ordination.

          This will lead to them developing the skills needed to:

          - hold and shake a rattle
          - grasp and bring objects to their mouth
          - open and shut their hands
          - swipe at hanging items such as toys attached to baby gyms

          ##4 to 6 months

          By 4 to 6 months old most babies will be able to:

          - grab their feet and toes when lying on their back
          - pass items from hand to hand

          $INFO

          You should provide even very young babies with opportunities to practise and develop fine motor skills.

          Early development of fine motor control will promote hand-eye co-ordination. This is linked to success with early literacy skills.

          ###Sensory activities

          You should provide babies with a wide range of items to handle and explore. The items will need to be clean, safe and appropriate to the baby’s age. You should check for broken or missing pieces, sharp edges and loose fixings to make sure they cannot cause any harm. You should ensure appropriate supervision during the activities.

          The EYFS framework requires adequate supervision of children all times. This should not limit children's experiences in settings, but some activities will require more risk assessment to make sure they are suitable.

          For very young babies, you will need to place items so the baby can reach them while lying down. Appropriate sensory activities for this age group could include textured items or baby gyms.

          As babies begin to sit, first supported and then unsupported, you can provide them with a wide variety of toys and everyday items. These may include:

          - household items including wooden spoons, dishes, measuring spoons and plastic cups
          - natural items including fir cones, sponges and large shells
          - noisy items including books and instruments

          ![A baby stood up in their cot, holding on to the side](/assets/5-1-1-4a-1351950980.jpg)

          From 7 to 12 months, a baby’s development will continue to be rapid. Babies will become increasingly mobile as they develop the skills to move around their environment. A baby’s weight will typically triple by their first birthday.

          A child of this age will need between 13 and 15 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. 9 to 11 of these hours will normally occur at night with the rest taken as naps during the day.

          From around 6 months, a baby may be ready for their first solid foods. The NHS advises that there are 3 clear signs that show that a baby is ready. These signs are that the baby is able to:

          - stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady
          - co-ordinate their eyes, hands and mouth so they can look at the food, pick it up and put it in their mouth by themselves
          - swallow food (rather than spit it back out)

          Once a baby is eating solid food, it is important that you prepare food safely for them and that you know how to stop a child from choking. This may involve pureeing foods and cutting food with skins lengthways to avoid a child's airways being blocked. There are different requirements for different ages. When babies and young children choke they may be silent, so you need to make sure they are supervised closely.

          You can find resources on weaning in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          It is important to continue to remember that all children will develop at their own individual rate.  If a baby or child is not at the expected level of development for their age they may simply need more time to practise. They may also not yet have had the opportunity to experience certain skills.

          ##Gross motor skills

          Gross motor skills development during this period will include:

          - sitting without support
          - beginning to crawl
          - standing while holding onto something

          Some babies may never crawl. Instead, they may find a different way of moving around such as shuffling on their bottom. This does not mean that you should wait to encourage standing activities because you think they will crawl first. Some babies may take their first steps towards the end of this period or even begin walking.

          ##Fine motor skills

          Fine motor skills development during this period will include:

          - reaching for things with a sweeping motion
          - pointing at objects
          - picking things up with their forefinger and thumb, known as the pincer grasp
          - indicating preferences with gestures
          - realising that they need to drop one thing to be able to pick up another

          $INFO

          As well as the activities for 0 to 6 month olds, you can now encourage babies to:

          - build and stack blocks
          - lift flaps in books
          - push, twist and pull to receive a response, such as pushing a button on a toy to see an animal pop up
          - move towards toys placed just out of their reach
          - move to music

          Children will still experience rapid growth in their second year of life. However, their development slows slightly in comparison to the previous 12 months.

          At some point during their second year most children will learn to walk unaided. Growth will also start to slow a little now. During this period most toddlers will grow between 10 and 12 cm and gain around 2.5 kg in weight.

          A child of this age will need between 11 to 14 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. At around 18 months old most children start to have only 1 day time sleep, with the rest occuring during the night.

          At this age children should be active for at least 3 hours (180 minutes) per day. This can include light activity such as standing and moving around and more energetic activity such as running, jumping and climbing. Their activities should include both indoor and outdoor play.

          At around 18 months to 2 years, children may be ready to start potty training. Most children can control their bowels before their bladder. Signs that a child is ready for potty training include:

          - they know when they've got a wet or dirty nappy
          - they get to know when they're peeing and may tell you they're doing it
          - the gap between wetting is at least an hour (if it's less, potty training may fail)
          - they show they need to pee by fidgeting or going somewhere quiet or hidden
          - they know when they need to pee and may say so in advance

          If you notice any of these signs in a child in your care, you should tell the child's parents or carers. When a child does start potty training, you should speak to parents and carers to see how you can provide support and consistency for children on this journey. You can find links to resources on potty training in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          ##Gross motor skills

          By 24 months most children will be able to:

          - kick a ball
          - run
          - stand on tiptoe
          - pull toys behind them or push them
          - climb up and down stairs with support
          - squat to pick an item up

          Other gross motor skills developing in this period will include:

          - crawling up steps
          - climbing onto chairs
          - dancing to music

          ##Fine motor skills

          By 24 months most children will be able to:

          - make marks with a pen or pencil held in their fist
          - attempt to use a fork or spoon with some success
          - turn the pages of a book 2 or 3 at a time
          - roll a large ball using their hands and arms

          $INFO

          You should encourage children to pick up and move items. Shape sorters, ball runs and posting activities will all help children practise grip, control and hand-eye co-ordination.

          Sing songs with accompanying actions, such as row, row, row your boat.

          Children will enjoy looking at books and particularly those that have interesting features like flaps to lift and noises to activate. Providing treasure and sensory baskets in your setting will encourage children to explore new objects.

          Children will enjoy being able to make marks and so will enjoy using crayons.  Remember to supervise the children to make sure that they don’t put the crayons in their mouths.

          When children are confident on their feet they will enjoy pushing and pulling toys such as trucks, pushchairs and trolleys.

          ![A child and a practitioner washing their hands together](/assets/5-1-1-6-1357628259.jpg)

          Children of this age will show an increased desire to be independent. This is a perfect opportunity to encourage skills during:

          - dressing and undressing
          - mealtimes
          - self care activities such as washing hands and toileting

          Children will still need around 12 to 14 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. The majority of this occurs at night with day time sleep periods becoming shorter.

          ##Gross motor skills

          Children will become more co-ordinated and stronger. This will result in more jumping, hopping and running.

          By 36 months, most children will be able to:

          - walk in a variety of directions such as sideways and backwards
          - jump on the spot with both feet off the floor
          - climb onto and use a riding toy such as a balance bike
          - climb stairs by placing both feet on one step at a time

          ##Fine motor skills

          By 36 months, most children's fine motor skills will become more controlled. Towards the end of this period, modelled items and drawings will be more recognisable.

          At this age, most children will be able to:

          - turn pages of a book one at a time
          - show a preferred hand when carrying out tasks
          - paint dots, lines and circular strokes with control
          - use larger fastenings on clothes like chunky buttons and zips
          - attempt to use scissors with supervision


          $INFO

          In addition to activities from previous age groups, children of this age may also enjoy:

          - using larger play equipment such as slides, seesaws and bikes
          - threading activities
          - control of creative materials such as crayons, paintbrushes and dough
          - construction with large bricks and blocks
          - cutting activities
          - puzzles
          - train and car tracks
          - imaginative play with gross motor activities, such as building small worlds with blocks and construction kits
          - action songs
          - role play using clothes with fasteners

          By 48 months, most children’s balance will have significantly improved. This means they will be able to ride bicycles, tricycles and scooters with more control. Most children start to show a preference for being left or right handed during this period. However, they may still continue to use both hands.

          During this period most toddlers will grow between 5 and 8 cm and gain around 1.8 kg (4 lb). They will need 10 to 13 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. It is important that you continue to work with parents or carers to meet children’s daytime sleep needs. However, most children will no longer be sleeping at all during the day.

          ##Gross motor skills

          By 48 months most children can carry out a wide variety of gross motor actions with confidence. Examples can include, but are not restricted to:

          - using large equipment such as slides and climbing frames independently
          - safely negotiating obstacles while running
          - throwing and catching a ball with accuracy
          - riding a tricycle or small bike with stabilisers
          - hopping and balancing on one foot
          - using large tools such as spades
          - dressing and undressing including negotiating fasteners
          - working as a team to move larger items, such as wood during den building activities

          ##Fine motor skills

          At this age most children will be able to:

          - grasp and confidently control a pencil or paintbrush and copy shapes such as a circle
          - build a tower of up to 9 small blocks
          - use tools with control, such as tapping in pegs with a small hammer
          - roll clay into balls, cylinders and flat shapes such as circles

          Children of this age should be active for at least 180 minutes per day. At least 60 minutes of this should be moderate to vigorous activity. Children should experience opportunities to be active in both indoor and outdoor areas. Children under 5 should not be inactive for prolonged periods of time, except when asleep.

          $INFO

          You can use a wide variety of activities with children of this age, including:

          - using large apparatus that offers opportunities to balance, climb or swing
          - team games including races, obstacle courses, basketball and football
          - creative activities including drawing, cutting, modelling and painting
          - water and sand play with sieves, tools and moulds
          - catching and throwing activities with balls, beanbags and frisbees
          - caring for dolls, including dressing and feeding
          - card games and puzzles
          - using everyday, open-ended materials to support overall co-ordination, for example sponges and cloths to hold, squash and throw, or wet and squeeze
          - activities with large shoulder and arm movements that encourage children to cross the mid-line of their bodies, such as painting on large vertical surfaces, twisting and clapping

          $INFO

          It is important to remember that all children will develop at their own rate and you will need to offer each child support in the right way to help them to succeed.

          You can continue to scaffold children’s physical development in a variety of ways.

          ##Demonstrating

          You can show children how to carry out the skill they need to use. This could include how to position their hands to catch the ball or how to place their feet on the steps of the slide to stay balanced.

          ##Choosing an appropriate group size

          Some children will learn best by watching others, for example their friends, whilst other children will need to be shown 1 to 1. You will need to make sure that children can work in the correct group size for how they learn best.

          ##Prompting

          You can ask children questions such as “do you remember when” or remind them of how they completed the task last time. This will help a child to think about the skill they need to use without the need for demonstration. This will encourage independence and will develop their confidence.

          ##Using children’s interests

          If a child is having difficulty grasping and controlling a pencil or paintbrush you can use a tracing sheet to encourage them to take part in drawing or painting activities. For example, if a child likes insects such as butterflies you can place greaseproof paper of a picture for them to draw over the top. This is likely to increase their confidence and they might even want to add colour or pattern to the finished item.

          ##Making movement fun

          You can encourage children to take part in music and movement, active stories or ball games such as throwing their ball to a person wearing red. This will engage children in an activity that lets them practice skills without the worry that they cannot achieve.

          ##Making things simpler

          You can change the way an activity is carried out whilst still including all children. Some examples could include

          - making the blocks bigger or using fewer bricks
          - reducing the number of obstacles or making the obstacles easier to negotiate
          - use larger tools that are easier to hold onto, for example larger handles or larger pegs

          This will make the activity achievable which will build children’s confidence and self-efficacy. Over a period of time, to suit the child’s needs, you can make the activity more challenging for example by increasing the bricks or obstacles. This will have given the child time to practice and master their skills whilst still taking part.

          Reflect on what you have read about the different stages of children’s physical development.

          Think about a day’s planning for your setting.

          - Which of your planned activities promote fine motor skills and gross motor skills?
          - How could you extend or improve on your planning to further promote these skills?

          Physical development theories
        body: |
          In previous modules you have considered many theories about how children develop. It is important to remember that theory is just that: theoretical ideas based on the research of an individual. Much the same as no single activity will suit the needs of all children, no one theory will influence how you support a child.

          Understanding the theory, along with criticisms and findings from more recent research, will help you when caring for the children in your setting.

          This topic includes the theories and thoughts of:

          - Vygotsky

        heading: |
          Theories of development: Lev Vygotsky
        body: |
          ![A child and a practitioner building a tower with blocks](/assets/5-1-2-2-1211964478.jpg)

          Lev Vygotsky believed that children learn and develop through:

          - the interactions they experience
          - the environment around them

          You looked at Vygotsky’s work and his zone of proximal development theory (ZPD) in Module 2 - Brain development in the early years.

          Vygotsky’s ZPD theory states that children have 2 stages of development. The first stage is the skills and knowledge they can develop by themselves. The second stage is the learning that can take place with the support of a more experienced individual. This individual is known as a more knowledgeable other (MKO). As the child becomes more confident and competent, the support is weaned away.

          As a practitioner you can use this theory by scaffolding children’s learning.

          Vygotsky believed this learning support could come from other children, and not just adults, as long as the other child was more knowledgeable. He also stressed the importance of play for developing skills and learning new concepts.

          ##Criticisms of Vygotsky's theory

          Critics argue that Vygotsky’s theory does not consider:

          - how to check whether the interaction with the MKO is at an appropriate level
          - whether the support from the MKO is making a significant impact
          - whether the ZPD applies to children of all ages

          ##Using Vygotsky's theories together with development checkpoints

          In ‘Development Matters’, the non-statutory curriculum guidance, there are ‘checkpoints’ rather than ‘checklists’. You can use the checkpoints to reflect on children’s development in the 3 prime areas. They’ll help you understand what children are doing well, and where they may need more support. The prime areas ensure a strong foundation for children’s development.

          A combination of Vygotsky’s theories and checkpoints will compliment each other to provide effective care. Development checkpoints can be used to identify where a MKO would be beneficial. You can then use Vygotsky’s ZPD theory and scaffolding techniques, combined with play, to help children learn. Later, you can revisit the milestones to identify whether the child has progressed.

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about development checkpoints and scaffolding.

          Think of a child in your care.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How can you use your knowledge of development checkpoints to help you care for this child effectively?
          - How can you use scaffolding and a more knowledgeable other (MKO) to help them develop their physical skills?
          - What benefits do you think each of these approaches has for the child?

          Factors affecting physical development

          There are many different factors that can affect a child's physical development. The impact of these factors can be positive or negative.

          You should not see these factors as barriers to a child's development. They are an opportunity to identify the support the child needs.

          You also should not assume that a child who has had positive experiences does not need your support.


          This topic includes:

          - Household factors
          - Nutrition
          - Additional needs

          ![A child reading a book with an adult](/assets/5-1-3-1-1383889737.jpg)

          Every child will have a different experience of care outside of your setting. Children will therefore have different starting points.

          There are many household and family factors that affect children’s development. The relationship between parents or carers and children is pivotal. Loving relationships and secure attachments help build the foundations for development, including physical development.

          The financial situation in a household can have an effect on children’s experiences, but it is important to avoid assumptions. You should work with children and their parents or carers to understand their individual needs.

          ##Access to activities and resources

          Parents and carers may feel pressure to provide costly resources or equipment, for example a bike or swing sets. They may also feel that physical activities cost money, for example trampoline parks or soft play areas.

          It is important to support parents and carers to understand that children can benefit greatly from free or low cost activities.

          For example:

          - moving to music for fun and to support development of gross motor skills
          - taking a treasure hunt walk for natural items like leaves, acorns or conkers at a park
          - building cushion forts or towers out of old cardboard boxes
          - involving children in everyday tasks like cooking to support development of fine motor skills

          These low-cost activities benefit physical development just as much as costly resources and activities. It is more important that a child experiences quality interactions and the support of a warm, responsive and loving adult to help them develop physical skills, confidence and language.


          ##Access to technology

          Household income and other factors may impact on a child’s access to technology. This could be both positive or negative. For example, if children have limited access to tablets or computers they may instead spend more time outdoors or being physically active.

          Increased screen time may lead to reduced movement or vigorous exercise depending on the age of the child. They may miss out on opportunities to learn physical skills from others, for example through group activities.

          ##Access to the outdoors

          Where a child lives may affect their activity and experiences. Children who live in houses with access to a garden or nearby park may be more likely to spend more time outdoors. In contrast, those who live in flats or city centres may spend less time in nature.

          The EYFS requires settings to provide an outdoor area or access to outdoor activities. You could encourage parents to use outdoor spaces for vigorous physical activity with their child.

          ##Diet

          Household income and time may affect a child’s diet. It is often cheaper to buy convenience foods than fruits, vegetables and certain cuts of meat. Some children may therefore miss out on nutritious, balanced or healthy options.

          The EYFS requirements are clear that “where children are provided with meals, snacks and drinks, they must be healthy, balanced and nutritious”.

          You can find links to suggested menus and information on nutrition in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          Sometimes children will eat vegetables or other foods at your setting that they may have refused at home. You could tell the child’s parents and carers as it may be worth them trying these foods again at home.

          ##Sleep

          A child’s quality of sleep can be affected by various factors, including household circumstances. For example, some children may not have their own bed. They may experience cold houses or go to bed feeling hungry. This could affect their ability to concentrate or their ability to take part in physical activities.

          ##Working in partnership with parents and carers

          Understanding each child’s home life can help you plan your curriculum and environment to meet their individual needs. It is important that children feel supported and understood at your setting.

          The EYFS says that each child must have a key person who takes responsibility for ensuring provision is tailored to their needs. The key person must also seek to engage with parents or carers to help guide children’s development at home.

          ##Adverse childhood experiences

          Adverse childhood experiences are stressful and traumatic events such as bereavement and trauma. When children are exposed to adverse childhood experiences, it will impact on their overall development.

          You can see more about how adverse child experiences can impact on development in module 3 (personal, social and emotional development).

          $INFO

          You should make sure you have procedures in place to support all children including:

          - an ambitious curriculum for all children no matter their starting points
          - each child having access to a key person who gets to know them well - this is a requirement of the EYFS
          - supplying outdoor clothing, like coats and wellington boots, for children that cannot bring these items from home - these could be donated from the community if your budget does not allow
          - ensuring children have access to a range of play equipment suitable for all levels of experience, either within your setting or at a local park or community group
          - daily physical activity and time outdoors - this is a requirement of the EYFS

          - How do you ensure that you support children from all backgrounds to progress and develop their physical skills?
          - How do you tailor your activities and equipment so that they are suitable for children with all levels of previous experience?

          </div>

          This is because a child’s diet will play a crucial role in their physical and holistic development. It is also important that healthy habits are instilled in children from an early age.

          A child’s diet will affect their:

          - healthy brain development
          - ability to concentrate and learn
          - weight
          - energy levels
          - ability to prevent and recover from illnesses (immunity)

          ##Eating a healthy diet

          Children need to eat a balance of all the food groups as soon as they start eating solid food. You can find a link to the NHS Eatwell Guide in the further reading section at the end of this module. This explains more about food groups and how they contribute to a healthy, balanced diet.

          Some food groups are particularly important for physical development. For example, protein is essential for supporting children's muscle development and strength. Calcium will ensure that children have strong bones. Carbohydrates and vitamin B from whole grains support good energy levels. This will in turn help children to take part in physical activities.

          Children also need to eat good fats as they help the body to absorb vitamins A, D and E and support brain development. Examples of good fats include oily fish, seeds, avocados and olive oil.

          ##Appetite and eating habits

          Children’s appetites will vary from child to child. Children have smaller stomachs than adults, so they need to eat smaller portions more often. It is important not to force children to eat more if they do not want to. Parents and carers will be keen to know whether their child is eating well. You can use these conversations as an opportunity to address any relevant concerns.

          Children’s experiences with food can impact on their eating habits. Examples of these experiences could include:

          - a traumatic experience such as choking, being burnt or excessive vomiting
          - knowing that a significant person in their life does not like a particular food
          - limited opportunities to try new foods

          ##Effects of a poor diet

          If children do not eat the right nutrients or enough calories they may lack the energy needed for physical activity or appear lethargic. Children who are lethargic could also have low iron levels.

          A diet that is too high in sugary and processed foods can contribute to obesity. Not being active for the recommended amount of time is another factor that can contribute to obesity. Being obese in childhood may increase the risk of long term complications in later life such as heart disease and diabetes.

          Children with a poor diet may also have difficulty concentrating. This will impact on their ability to follow instructions and complete physical activities. Children may experience tummy troubles such as constipation as a result of a lack of fibre. In extreme cases this can cause discomfort, distract them from learning, or lead to time away from the setting.

          ##Oral health

          What a child eats and drinks can impact their oral health. It is important that children do not have large amounts of sugary food. In your setting, you should offer water instead of fruit juice and fizzy pop. When you offer snacks, you should offer healthy choices. This will limit the amount of acid in children’s mouths.

          If children consume acidic food and drinks over a prolonged period it can erode the tooth enamel. This in turn can lead to a higher risk of decay and cavities.

          $INFO

          A series of menus have been created to support you and your setting to offer healthy, balanced and nutritious meals for children. The guidance ensures that children are offered food and drink that meets current dietary recommendations and the EYFS welfare requirements. You can find details in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          It is important to ensure that the food you serve to children is suitable for their age and development. Many foods may also pose a choking risk if not prepared correctly. You can find further advice on food safety, safe weaning and choking prevention in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          Reflect on what you have read about how nutrition affects children’s physical development.

          Think about your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you help children understand the importance of healthy eating?
          - Are there any additional activities or resources you could use to improve their understanding?
          - How do you ensure any meals and snacks you provide are healthy and nutritious?
          - What actions could you take if you suspected a child was not receiving a fully balanced diet?

          Children may have a physical impairment that impacts on their movement or ability to complete certain tasks. The impairment may be lifelong such as a disability or temporary such as a broken limb. Children may have been born with their disability or it may be as a result of a trauma or accident.

          Examples of physical disability may include:

          - cerebral palsy
          - spina bifida
          - sight impairment
          - hearing impairment

          It is important that you offer the right support to make the curriculum and environment accessible for children with additional needs. You should work in partnership with your setting’s SENCO, where relevant.

          You may need to make changes to your planning and resources to make your environment and curriculum accessible. For physical activities, these changes could include:

          - using a ball with a bell in it for children with sight impairments
          - providing seated alternatives for children in wheelchairs

          Depending on a child's individual needs, other professionals may be involved in their care. For example a paediatric occupational therapist may support children to improve skills around:

          - eating
          - dressing
          - co-ordination
          - using their hands and spatial awareness

          They will assess the child's needs and identify whether they could benefit from any specialist equipment. This could include adapted feeding equipment and furniture. You can also receive help with supporting mobility with lifting.

          You will look at additional needs and specialist support in more detail in a later module.

          If children are not supported and challenged to develop their physical skills it can impact on all areas of development.

          A child’s physical ability will affect their:

          - independence
          - confidence
          - overall health and wellbeing.

          All children will develop at a different rate. It is important that you have a good understanding of children’s individual starting points and how physical development supports and affects all other areas of development.

          The next section of this module includes:

          - The holistic impact of physical development

          A child’s stage of physical development can impact their engagement and overall development. This impact can be both positive and negative.

          This topic includes how children’s physical skills can impact upon their:

          - health and wellbeing
          - behaviour and independence
          - cognitive and language development

          A child’s ability to participate in physical movement will affect their overall health and wellbeing. When children receive a balanced diet and participate in the recommended levels of physical activity, they will receive a broad range of benefits, such as:

          - maintaining a healthy weight
          - reducing the risk of disease
          - improving brain health
          - improved mobility
          - efficient function of heart and lungs
          - better sleep
          - improved co-ordination
          - improved strength

          As well as the physical benefits, being active can also have a positive impact on children’s mental health. Practising and mastering a skill, like throwing and catching a ball with control, can help to build a child’s confidence.

          You will need to make sure that all children have access to a wide range of activities regardless of their gender, individual needs and previous experiences.

          Activities will also need to be achievable with appropriate challenge and support. If a child is not able to make progress, they will not feel a sense of achievement. It is important that you know about each child’s starting point with physical skills. This will ensure that you can plan a suitable curriculum and environment in which these activities are available.

          $INFO

          You can use physical activities to encourage children to work together in small groups or as part of a team. Playing together in this way can help children to build positive relationships and create a sense of belonging. Some examples can include:

          - parachute play
          - obstacle courses
          - drawing around each other
          - rolling a ball between them
          - using a seesaw
          - sharing water play resources

          $INFO

          Some children may have difficulty sitting down for learning activities and may become frustrated. This will impact on their ability to concentrate. In your setting, you could combine this learning activity with physical activity. For example, you could practise counting by counting steps or searching for numbered items to order.

          A child’s ability to access and use toys, feed themselves and participate in activities will affect their confidence. Where children have confidence in their physical ability, they are more likely to have high self-efficacy. This means they will tackle situations believing that they can succeed. Children with high self-efficacy and resilience are more likely to take part and persevere in activities and environments that they find challenging.

          In contrast, if children lack confidence with their physical skills they may worry about not being able to complete a task. This may lead to them being reluctant to join in with others. During child led activities they may avoid tasks that require a specific gross or fine motor skill, like climbing up steps or being able to control a paintbrush.

          Regular observation and assessment of children will help you to plan to meet their needs. For example, you could use one to one activities or use children’s interests to increase engagement and motivation.

          Reflect on what you have read about the impact of physical development on children’s health and wellbeing.

          Think about a recent physical movement activity or outdoor experience you planned and carried out in your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - What was the intended outcome of the activity or experience?
          - To what extent did it achieve this outcome?
          - Could you have extended or improved the activity or experience to better meet the intended outcome?
          - What benefits did the activity or experience have for the children?
          - How could you tell?

          Empowering children
        body: |
          ![A boy choosing what he wants to wear](/assets/5-2-1-2-1214469378.jpg)

          You should empower children to be ambitious for themselves. It is important that they build self-worth, self-efficacy and independence.

          A lack of independence due to limited physical skills may impact on a child’s feeling of self-worth. This may affect the child’s self-efficacy and some children may become more reluctant to try.

          To build independence and self-worth, set children small tasks that result in lots of praise and achievement. This could include:

          - dressing, undressing and using fasteners, for example zipping up their own coat
          - feeding themselves, from finger foods through to using cutlery confidently
          - ensuring that handwashing facilities and toilets are at the correct height and easily accessible
          - giving children the opportunity to serve themselves at mealtimes
          - allowing more time for them to carry out tasks with less support such as washing hands before lunch

          It is important to consider how the learning activities you plan will help build the skills needed for independence. For example, providing jugs and cups in the role play area and during water play will allow children to practise pouring and control skills. This will help them later at snack time. You can also provide role play clothing with fasteners such as zips and buttons. This will help children practise the essential skills needed for dressing and undressing.

          Children need lots of opportunity to see you using these skills. They will also benefit from your guidance. It is important to consider how your adult led activities can support and promote the skills needed for independence.

          When children want to be independent but cannot, because they have not yet mastered the necessary skills, this may show as frustration. Your response to this frustration will affect how a child feels about trying again. It is important not to take over the task for the child.

          You will need to encourage children to keep trying, and adapt your support to each child. You should also recognise that children may not have been able to see or practise a skill outside of the setting, or may simply take longer to master a task.

          Some children may need extra support as a result of an additional need. Where necessary, you can also adapt the equipment that you use to help all children to succeed. Examples of extra support could include:

          - suction cutlery for independent feeding
          - chunky fasteners on clothing
          - mobility aids in the bathroom

          You will look at additional needs in more detail in a future module.

          ![A girl on a climbing frame](/assets/5-2-1-3a-981125652.jpg)

          Research shows that increased physical activity supports children’s cognitive development.

          In Module 2 you learned that during the third trimester of pregnancy, a fatty substance called myelin begins to coat the neurones in the baby’s brain. This is called myelination and it increases the speed at which messages are sent around the brain.

          You also learned that after birth, when a baby repeats and practises a skill, it leads to further myelination of the neurones involved. This improves the speed at which the message travels and so improves the skill. When children have opportunities to learn and rehearse new skills, such as grabbing, rolling, sitting and jumping, it encourages brain activity. This in turn results in improved skills.

          Engaging in physical activity also increases the flow of blood to the brain. This improves concentration, memory, thinking and cognitive skills, which are all vital for a child’s development.

          Fine and gross motor activities will also help to build children’s language and communication skills. This is because children will hear a wide range of vocabulary relating to actions and movements. For example, during activities you may say to children "I hear the scissors slicing through the paper, slice, slice. What can you hear?" or "I see you were concentrating and caught the ball by stretching your arms high overhead."

          Carrying out fine and gross motor activities helps a child to explore their environment. It also encourages them to question what things are, how they work and how they can be used. This will improve their language and communication as they have conversations with others.

          Physical activities will encourage sustained shared thinking. This is where children work together to solve problems, share ideas and experiment. This will develop their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. It will also encourage their curiosity further, resulting in more new language learned.

          Every child’s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have been different. As a result, it could have had both positive and negative impacts on their physical development. You should consider each child’s individual experiences and identify the support they need.

          This topic includes:

          - The potential positive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
          - The potential negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic

          ##Increased time at home

          If parents and carers spent more time at home, children may have had more time for physical activity or to complete activities together.

          If parents and carers were already active, or were able to use long periods at home to become active, children may have experienced more movement. For example, if parents or siblings were already runners, or took up running, children may have been running or ridden their bikes more.

          Babies and young children may have experienced a slower pace for their daily routine. This in turn may have led to more independence. For example, mealtimes may have been longer, so parents and carers had more time to show children how to use cutlery. Or, children may have had more time to practise getting dressed independently. This will have helped them to practise the co-ordination of fine and gross motor skills to carry out tasks.

          ##Access to online activities

          There were several online physical activity initiatives during the lockdown periods. Children with access to the internet, tablets or computers may have benefitted from taking part in these activities alone or with family members.

          ##Freedom to explore

          If children were able to experience an outdoor environment with no time constraints, they may have benefitted from freedom to explore or learn new skills. For example, they could have learned how to forward roll or take part in racing activities. Extended time to practise will have improved their strength, agility, balance and confidence.

          ##Increased creativity

          Children may have benefitted from more time to explore during activities like:

          - messy play
          - drawing and painting
          - role play

          This will have allowed children to practise picking up, holding and controlling items. In turn, they may now have improved fine motor control.

          ##New hobbies

          With more time to prepare meals, children may have been more involved in food preparation. This will have given them experience of using tools in real life situations. It will also have improved children’s knowledge and understanding of the importance of healthy eating and good nutrition.

          Children may have also had the chance to take part in gardening activities. This will have given them opportunities to practise their control of tools and learn about growing their own food.

          ##No or limited access to outdoor spaces

          Some children may have had limited access to outdoor space. This could be because they live in city centres or in accommodation without gardens.

          ##Increased screen time

          Children may have spent longer sitting still, watching TV or using computers and tablets. A sedentary lifestyle, which involves sitting still or lying down for extended periods, can negatively impact a child’s health.

          A sedentary lifestyle can also:

          - impact on a child’s sleep routine
          - increase the likelihood of chronic illness in later life, such as heart disease and diabetes

          How active a child is will also have an impact on children's overall feelings of health and well being. This is because being active releases endorphins and serotonins, which help to reduce the risk of depression and anxiety.

          ##Groups stopped

          Before the pandemic, children may have attended organised parent and toddler groups or activity sessions focussed on physical activity. These will have stopped during lockdowns. This will have reduced the opportunities for socialisation. It will also have meant that children had less chances to build their confidence with movement in the presence of others.

          When this has not been part of children’s daily routines for a long time, it may be more difficult to reintroduce these activities. Children may have become anxious or shy when meeting with larger groups. They may therefore be reluctant to take part.

          ##Lack of role models

          Some children may not have observed positive role models for physical activity during the lockdown periods. Children are influenced by the people around them and are likely to adopt the same routines and activities. Where this has included limited movement or gross motor activity, children will become used to this sedentary lifestyle.

          Even at an early age children can become motivated to learn a new skill or take up a hobby as a result of their role models. As well as parents, carers or siblings, this could also be the role models they see during televised sporting events and at social activities. During lockdown periods children will not have been exposed to these events.

          ##Not seeing a dentist

          Children will have had limited or no access to dentist appointments. If this has been combined with poor nutrition or oral care, they may have developed cavities and be experiencing discomfort. This can then impact on children’s sleep and eating habits, leading to a lack of energy and concentration. This can leave children reluctant to take part in physical activities.

          You will need to consider each child’s experience of the pandemic when planning your curriculum and activities. This will ensure that you have an accurate starting point from which to plan.

          It is essential that you plan a curriculum and environment that encourages children to move and develop physical skills. NHS guidelines say that:

          - babies should be encouraged to be active throughout the day in a variety of ways, including crawling and tummy time
          - children aged 1 to 2 should be physically active for at least 180 minutes every day
          - children aged 3 to 4 should spend at least 180 minutes every day being physically active, and at least 60 minutes of this should be moderate-to-vigorous activity

          You can find the NHS physical activity guidelines for children under 5 years in the further reading section at the end of this module.

          Gathering information when a child starts in your setting, and continuing to observe them, will help you identify the child’s current level of physical development.

          You will be able to combine this information with your understanding of the expected stage of development for their age. With this knowledge, you can plan an effective curriculum to support each child to be ambitious in a safe and challenging environment.

          ##Physical literacy

          It is your role to promote and support physical literacy for the children in your care. Physical literacy is the confidence, motivation and skill levels needed to participate in physical activities. You can promote physical literacy by:

          - providing lots of activities that support children’s physical skills
          - making physical activity part of a regular routine
          - being a good role model
          - offering lots of praise and encouragement for engagement in physical activities
          - introducing and reinforcing language relating to movement and physical skills

          - How does your planning help to ensure that children experience a variety of different activities and equipment?
          - How do you encourage children to try activities and use equipment that they are less interested in or comfortable with?
          - How do you incorporate children’s individual interests into physical activities and experiences?
          - How could you build or improve upon these strategies?

          In addition to parents and carers, you will be a significant role model in children’s lives. It is important that you model positive behaviours which help children to understand the importance of the choices they make.

          ##Personal hygiene

          Children will look to you to help them understand when and how to wash their hands and complete toileting routines independently. Washing your hands with children is a positive way to show them the crucial steps involved. For example, you can show them the importance of using soap and drying their hands thoroughly.

          Stories and rhymes are also a fun way of helping children to understand the importance of washing their hands. This will motivate them to remember and repeat their actions.

          ##Oral health

          Your setting might participate in a supervised toothbrushing programme which will provide you with opportunities to discuss the importance of limiting sugary foods and brushing regularly. Other ways to promote positive oral health can include planning activities, stories and discussions to help children to understand:

          - how foods and drinks will affect their teeth
          - what happens at the dentist
          - how to brush their teeth using dolls or stuffed toys

          ##Healthy eating

          You will need to plan activities to help children understand the importance of a healthy diet.

          Snack and mealtimes can be used as a social time to talk about:

          - the food children are eating
          - their favourite foods
          - the difference between healthy and unhealthy foods

          Children will need to see you making healthy choices and eating meals together in an unhurried, sociable way. This will support their positive relationship with food. You can also encourage them to help with food preparation, to support independence for the future.

          Children must have access to drinking water throughout the day. They should also see you drinking water. You should talk with children about the importance of drinking water and the impact fizzy and sugary drinks can have on their teeth.

          ##Medical appointments

          You can use role play activities to help children to prepare for medical appointments or to promote further conversation at home. For example, you could set up an area within your setting to role play going to see a doctor or dentist. This will make children familiar with what will happen at their appointment. You can support this with stories and discussions using puppets or stuffed animals. This can also start conversations at home if you are able to share resources, or if children talk about their day with their parents or carers.

          ##Physical activity

          Children should be able to access outdoor space in all weathers. You will need to plan for this within your daily routine. For babies, this may be an opportunity for a walk in the pushchair or having tummy time on a mat in a shady area. As children become mobile this can include push along toys and equipment to navigate. You should encourage and take part in physical activity with enthusiasm, as children will be influenced by your approach.

          You can also take an enthusiastic approach to taking part in creative activities or movement to music. Children will then see that you value the importance of fine and gross motor movement. This will in turn motivate them to carry out similar activities.

          The physical environment of your setting should support you in your role. The routine, resources and activities should include lots of opportunities for children to experience and develop different physical skills.

          When planning your environment, you should also consider the characteristics of effective teaching and learning as identified in the statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (EYFS).

          These characteristics are:

          - playing and exploring - children investigate and experience things, and ‘have a go’
          - active learning - children concentrate and keep on trying if they encounter difficulties, and enjoy achievements
          - creating and thinking critically - children have and develop their own ideas, make links between ideas, and develop strategies for doing things

          This topic includes:

          - Adult led activity
          - Child led activity
          - Meeting individual needs
          - Inclusive practice
          - Managing risk

          Children need opportunities to learn from the environment and the people around them. This will happen during adult led activities and experiences. However, it can also happen through interaction with their peers and child led play.

          It is important that you plan the environment to encourage a wide variety of opportunities and experiences to promote effective and ambitious development.

          Adult led activities will give you opportunities to make sure that children develop their skills correctly. For example, you will need to show children how to hold and use cutlery, crayons or a pair of scissors to ensure they can use them effectively.

          Children will also need to hear the language associated with their physical movements. For example, how will a child know what a hop is if they have never been shown what it looks like or heard the word hop used in combination with the movement?

          Adult led opportunities will enable you to correct and shape children’s actions to support their development. While you will have these opportunities during child led activity, you may not always see every action. Adult led activity also helps you to target the gaps you have identified between a child’s starting point and their expected stage of development.

          After children have observed your skills they will need to test their new knowledge through imitation and practice. You can help them do this by making sure that they can access areas and activities that promote physical skills throughout the day.

          $INFO

          For babies, adult led activities could include:

          - songs with action and/or movements
          - rolling balls
          - completing puzzles or shape sorting activities
          - using equipment such as rockers, push along toys and musical instruments
          - building blocks
          - looking at books, particularly those with flaps to lift or items to feel

          For toddlers and older children, adult led activities could include:

          - songs with actions or movements
          - parachute play
          - throwing and catching activities
          - using large equipment such as slides, seesaws and bicycles
          - cookery
          - scientific experiments such as creating volcanoes

          Child led activity
        body: |
          You have learned about child led activity in previous modules. You will now know that children often feel more freedom during activities they have initiated and led themselves. This is because they often feel that they have more control of the outcomes, without the worry that they might not get something right.

          Children will need lots of opportunities to practise their physical skills. This will allow them to gain control over both their fine and gross motor skills. You will need to plan the layout of your room and activities to promote this.

          $INFO

          For babies, child led activities could include:

          - treasure baskets
          - push or pull along toys
          - a wide variety of sensory items, such as textured books, musical instruments or baby rattles
          - opportunities to lie down and roll
          - opportunities to reach for hanging items to promote movement, grabbing, pushing, and pulling
          - stackable equipment, such as rings or blocks

          For toddlers and older children child led activities could include:

          - access to equipment to build their own outdoor obstacle course, such as cones or ramps
          - a mark making table or painting station
          - role play clothes with a variety of fasteners
          - materials for construction activities, such as making craft models or building with wooden blocks
          - puzzles
          - modelling materials, such as clay, plasticine and dough
          - water, sand and messy play materials, such as gloop and foam
          - items to thread, such as beads or pasta shapes

          Children must always be supervised when taking part in these activities.

          $INFO

          All of the activities that have been listed as child led can also be used as adult led activities. This is because you can scaffold the children’s learning as needed.

          For example, an obstacle course has been listed in both the adult and child led ideas. You might begin by planning an obstacle course to specifically help a child to improve their balance and coordination and you will guide the child throughout the obstacle course.

          You can do this by demonstrating how to place one foot in front of the other on the beam or how to jump and land on both feet. The next time you help the child you might use prompts to ask them “do you remember how to place your feet to balance on the beam?”

          After the child has developed the necessary skills you might watch from further away. Eventually the child may create the course themselves or join in with no adult support. This has now become a child led activity that they can use to continue to master their skills.

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about balancing adult and child led activities for physical development.

          Think about the activities that you planned for a recent day in your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - What opportunities did the activities include for children to develop their physical skills?
          - Did children use their physical skills naturally, or because you specifically planned opportunities for them to do so?
          - How could you develop your planning to extend or improve on these activities?

          ![A child being supported to use a balance board](/assets/5-3-2-2-909419644.jpg)

          Children cannot be excluded from activities because they have an additional need that prevents them from using certain resources or areas of the environment.

          You will need to assess each child’s individual needs and work with the child’s parents and carers, and where applicable other professionals, to ensure that the child’s needs are still met. This will include adaptations to your setting and activities, along with additional equipment in your setting.

          These may include:

          - ensuring that the furniture layout enables all children to move around freely
          - providing chunky pens and paintbrushes or grips that can be added to thinner items to ensure children with fine motor needs can handle items
          - using suction plates with cutlery attached to encourage independence for children experiencing fine motor control difficulties
          - offering alternative upper body activities for children with limited gross motor development, for example seated ball games
          - offering equipment for individuals with sight impairments such as balls with bells
          - altering the height of equipment such as painting easels to enable children to be seated

          You will learn about meeting children’s individual needs in more detail in a later module.

        body: |
          ![A child playing football with a practitioner](/assets/5-3-2-3-1288919384.jpg)

          All children should be encouraged to participate in a wide range of activities regardless of their gender and it is important to avoid stereotypical behaviour. For example you should not assume that girls will not be able to or want to participate in a game of football or climb trees during forest school. Equally you should not presume that boys will not want to take part in dressing up or dancing.

          It is essential that all children are given the opportunity to experience the whole curriculum and identify their own likes, dislikes and preferences without influence.

          Strategies to encourage all children to participate can include:

          - create a safe space where children know that trying new and different things is celebrated
          - offering and encouraging choices to support children to try new things
          - mixed gender and ability groups for physical activities to encourage teamwork and inclusion
          - praise, reward and celebration when children try new activities or skills - especially where they are not yet able to succeed
          - challenging stereotypes with children, for example reinforcing that boys are welcome in the home corner if you hear children preventing this

          Children need to see and use resources that they can relate to, such as children with similar characteristics to them carrying out physical activity. This will support the children to build positive self image and encourage them to try new things and strive to achieve. This will also ensure all children are learning in an environment that celebrates the diversity of the world they are growing up in.

          ##Cultural diversity

          You have learned about the importance of a culturally diverse environment in previous modules and this is just as important with physical development.

          Being able to handle items that may be unfamiliar to them such as chopsticks, bongo drums or a Sari will support their understanding of the diverse world they live in while also testing their fine and gross motor skills.

          Managing risk

          ![A child on a rope climbing frame](/assets/5-3-2-4-1435963898.jpg)

          It is important for children to experience a balance between risk and challenge. You will need to use each child’s individual starting point as a guide of what this looks like.

          Children’s experience of risk and challenge will vary greatly. There are a number of factors that can affect a child’s desire or ability to take risks.

          ##Parents' and carers' attitude to risk

          Children may have grown up in a risk averse household where they will not have been encouraged to participate in anything their parents and carers considered risky. Alternatively, children may live in households where they are encouraged to be daring, or where parents and carers may seem unaware of potential risks and dangers.

          ##Low self-efficacy

          Children who are very confident are usually not afraid to take risks. This is because they believe they can overcome challenges.

          Children with low self-efficacy will believe that they are likely to fail before even attempting something new. This means they will be even more reluctant to try something that they think is risky.

          ##Resources and opportunities

          Some children may have had regular opportunity to visit open spaces with trees to climb. Others may have had opportunity to use a slide or seesaw. Some children might not have experienced either.

          ##Previous experiences

          If children have hurt themselves, such as a grazed knee or bumped head, whilst taking part in activities previously they may be more reluctant to try again.

          All of these experiences will affect how children approach activities and their current level of skill and knowledge. You should use your knowledge of each child, along with your settings risk assessment procedure when planning activities. These activities should be stage appropriate and encourage challenge while keeping them safe and making them aware of the potential risks involved.

          For example, children can be encouraged to participate in an obstacle course that includes using a ladder. You will have:

          - completed a risk assessment that ensures that you are using sufficient safety equipment such as soft mats placed around the ladder and that all hazards have been removed
          - considered the necessary supervision - depending on your setting this may mean children taking part in the activity one at a time

          During the activity you will need to strike a balance between encouraging the children to try independently, while using your knowledge of each child to know who might be reluctant and who might try to rush and climb too high.

          Children need to learn to manage risk to ensure that they can face challenging situations and be ambitious in their learning. Children will also use this knowledge to build an understanding of their own limits and boundaries, along with the potential consequences of their actions. This knowledge will help them to self-regulate their own decisions.

          $BRAIN

          Think about your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you manage risk whilst providing a challenging environment?
          - How do you help children to understand and manage risk?
          - How do you support children who are more risk averse to take appropriate risk?

          The outdoor environment

          ![A child outside, wearing warm clothing. They are crouched down, looking at something on the ground](/assets/5-3-2-5a-514421140.jpg)

          Research shows us that children who regularly access outdoor environments have improved strength, agility and coordination. This is because running, climbing and swinging use different movements, muscles and control to those needed for indoor movement. Children who develop new movement skills also develop greater self confidence as they learn to make it to the top of the slide or successfully negotiate an obstacle course.

          There are many holistic benefits to regular access to outdoor environments. Children naturally become even more curious when they are outside which will result in spontaneous learning opportunities. Spending time in daylight can support children’s overall mood and the exposure to vitamin D supports the development of strong and healthy bones and teeth. You should follow the NHS guidance on sun safety, which is linked to in the further reading section.

          Outdoor environments create opportunities for social interaction and communication as children work together to negotiate equipment, take turns and solve problems. Examples of outdoor activities and their benefits include:

          - exploring natural environments near your setting - this has a wide range of benefits, including supporting children's core strength, stability, balance, spatial awareness, co-ordination, and agility
          - mud kitchens, water activities and and sand trays, which provide children with opportunities to pour, dig and make shapes
          - chalk and messy play, such as painting rocks, which provide opportunities for children to develop their grasp and control skills
          - gardening activities which provide opportunities for children to use tools in real life situations and support their understanding of how food is grown
          - large outdoor games such as hopscotch, snakes and ladders or obstacle courses which help children to develop further control of their balance, spatial awareness and agility while building their stamina
          - space to run, throw balls and beanbags and practise using equipment such as hula hoops, which supports children’s spatial awareness, agility and coordination

          ##Bad weather

          Bad weather can sometimes limit children’s outdoor activity, but with the exception of lightning and bad storms there are safe ways to enjoy outdoor activity in most weather conditions.

          In your setting, you should plan for children to be outside in all weathers. Children should have access to appropriate clothing, layers, sun cream and appropriate shelter to enable this all year round. It’s important that you also have access to suitable clothing, so you don’t get cold, wet or sunburnt.

          Reflect on what you have read about the importance of the outdoor environment for children’s physical skill development.

          Parents and carers are the most knowledgeable people about their child. You will need this knowledge to ensure that you are able to support children’s physical development effectively.

          Children’s experience of physical activity outside your setting will vary. There are many factors which may influence this. Examples of factors could include:

          - parents and carers with physical disabilities
          - living accommodation without access to outdoor space
          - parents and carers with limited time
          - parents and carers with previous negative experience of physical activity
          - a lack of understanding of the benefits of physical activities
          - limited understanding of expected development


          ##Supporting parents and carers with physical activity

          ###Invite parents or carers into your setting

          It is important to create and offer opportunities for parents and carers to come into the setting, both when children first start at your setting and throughout their time with you. This will provide opportunities for you to tell them about the different skills and knowledge their child will be developing and for them to see examples of activities in a physically active environment.

          When parents and carers drop off and collect their child, you should welcome them into the setting so they can see the activities their child enjoys and the skills they are developing. You could use events such as a sports morning to engage parents and carers with physical activity in your setting.

          ###Share information with parents and carers

          Sharing examples of the activities that their children carry out in the setting will support parents’ and carers’ understanding of appropriate activities to aid their child’s development. At handovers at the end of the day you can:

          - share with parents what children are learning and their progress
          - praise the effort a child put into the day's activities, in the child's presence

          These valuable discussions can also support consistency of approach between home and the setting. Some settings choose to hold dedicated parent-practitioner sessions, but it can be done well during handovers.

          Some settings take photos to share with parents and carers, but it is important to ensure this does not take up too much time. Practitioners, childminders and nurseries should avoid recording or collecting lots of information or creating journals for parents. This takes away from valuable time spent caring for, teaching, playing, chatting and interacting with children. These things matter more for children’s development than spending lots of time capturing information or photos.

          ###Encourage activity outside your setting

          Where possible you can share resources for children to take home. This could include the resources needed to carry out a threading activity or story sacks that involve movement. It is also important to include a wide range of activities that require minimal or no equipment. This could be a list of songs currently being sung or inspiration to put music on and dance together.

          You could send children home with a challenge such as a treasure hunt sheet or craft activity to be completed. This will encourage parents to become involved in both their child’s learning and their physical development.

          You can share information about local opportunities for physical activity with parents and carers. These could include organised social walks, woodland trails, parent and toddler groups, swimming clubs, gymnastic activities and bike parks. It is important to include a wide range of costs in your suggestions, including those that are free.

          ![A child and practitioner brushing their teeth together](/assets/5-3-3-2-1226028898.jpg)

          The most recent survey carried out by Public Health England in 2015 showed that 25% of 5 year olds had some tooth decay. These children had experienced tooth decay affecting 4 teeth, on average. Between 2014 and 2016 only 38% of 0 to 4 year olds had visited a dentist. Tooth extraction was the 6th most common hospital procedure for children under 5.

          There is a misconception that when baby teeth fall out, adult teeth will not be affected by any previous issues. This is not the case. If children lose teeth early as a result of decay adult teeth may not be ready to erupt. This can leave opportunity for other teeth to move around, affecting how much room the adult tooth does have when it comes through. If children develop infection as a result of decay it may remain in the gum which can result in discoloured or malformed adult teeth and ongoing problems.

          Poor dental health can impact across several areas of a child’s development, including their:

          - eating habits as pain or tooth loss may impact on their food choices
          - sleep patterns interrupted by pain
          - lost learning opportunities as children miss time from the setting as a result of pain or dental appointments
          - relationship building and participation in social situations as they feel self-conscious
          - speech and language issues

          You can share the importance of good dental health with babies, children, parents and carers by:

          - using resources such as books, displays and activities that show trips to the dentist and children brushing teeth
          - including a role play area that helps children to understand what a trip to the dentist will involve
          - using teddy bears or dolls to carry out a morning hygiene routine including toothbrushing
          - completing creative activities using tooth images and messages about good oral health

          There will be a wide variety of factors affecting what a child eats. These could include:

          - the cost of food
          - time to prepare meals and snacks
          - confidence with food preparation skills
          - parents and carers who have experienced difficulties with food and eating
          - medical conditions
          - frustrations surrounding children being fussy eaters

          $INFO

          The EYFS requires you to support children with understanding the importance of healthy foods. There may also be opportunities to share this with parents and carers. In your setting you could:

          - get children involved in preparing food
          - build a setting cookbook that everyone can contribute to
          - share the setting’s menus
          - have a healthy eating section in your updates to parents and carers that include healthy options and pictures of food prepared by the children
          - learn about traditional foods during cultural celebrations
          - plan food related trips such as to a local supermarket or farm shop
          - invite parents to come into the setting to take part in cookery activities

          Reflect on what you have read about encouraging healthy nutrition.

          Think about your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you engage parents and carers in their children’s health and nutrition?
          - What support do you offer parents and carers to help them with healthy eating at home?
          - Are there any strategies you have read about which you don’t currently use?
          - If so, which do you think would work well in your setting and why?

          Sharing your knowledge and understanding of development

          Just as you need to know about a child’s starting point to support them effectively, parents and carers will need to have a good understanding of what skills they should be developing and promoting with their child.

          If parents and carers have limited understanding of the physical development skills they should expect at each stage of their child’s development, they will not know how to support and challenge their child. While it is important to reassure parents and carers that all children will develop at their own pace, it is also important to encourage them to strive for ambitious outcomes for their children.

          You could talk to parents and carers or use your updates to ensure that parents receive information about the expected stages of physical development for their child’s current age and their stage of expected development. You could share the 'What to expect in the EYFS' guide for parents with them. You can find a link to this document in the further reading section of this module.

          You should use opportunities to discuss a child’s current level of development with parents and carers. There may be differences between what parents and carers see and what you observe in your setting. For example, children may have access to a balance bike in your setting but not at home. Without discussion, parents may not be aware that this is a skill that their child is developing or that they can help support these balancing skills at home.

          A child may be less independent at home as a result of support from older siblings, parents and carers and they may not be aware that the child is able to velcro their own shoes or wash their hands independently.

          Information will change continuously as each child develops and it is important that you maintain effective communication. Information, such as findings from your observations, should be shared regularly to support early intervention and promote progress. This may be done through a dedicated app, paper based information sent home, photographs or other ways you communicate with parents and carers.

          Information should:

          - be easy for parents and carers to understand
          - clearly show what stage the child is at and what they are working towards
          - where applicable include ideas for supporting children at home

          You will learn about observation, assessment and planning in more detail in a future module.

          Babies and children move through typical stages while they are developing their physical skills. Understanding these typical stages will help you identify speech and language problems early.

          There are many different factors that can affect a child’s physical development, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of these factors can be both positive and negative.

          As a practitioner, you play a central role in identifying and supporting children’s physical development needs. By combining your knowledge of each child with your professional judgement, you can make sure they receive the right support and prevent any potential gaps in development.

          Children’s physical skills will support them in many other areas of development including becoming independent, acquiring cognitive skills and building positive relationships.

          To support their physical development skills, all children need to experience an active environment that:

          - promotes opportunities to move and explore
          - supports them to build their confidence
          - encourages them to be ambitious with a balance of risk and challenge

          Your role is central to this. Children will learn from observing and copying your behaviour. You should be an active and enthusiastic role model that promotes movement and a healthy lifestyle.

          Building a positive relationship with parents and carers will ensure that you are able to encourage active and healthy homes which will offer children consistent care to achieve a healthy lifestyle now and in later life.
