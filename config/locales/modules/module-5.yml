          Supporting physical development in the early years
        body: |
          On completion of this module, you will be able to:

          - identify and explore the stages of physical development in the early years
          - review the potential factors that can affect physical development
          - explain the impact of physical skills on learning and development
          - consider the role of the practitioner and the environment to support children’s physical development

          The EYFS identifies physical development as a prime area of learning and development.

          Physical activity plays a vital role in children’s all-round development. It will support them to:

          - master control of their body
          - build healthy habits that lead to lifelong traits 
          - decrease the risk of developing difficulties with their health in later life

          Children’s physical development falls under two headings - gross motor skills and fine motor skills.

          Gross motor skills are those that use large body movements. Examples of gross motor skills include walking, jumping and climbing. 

          Fine motor skills are those that use the hands and wrists. Examples of fine motor skills include grasping, hand eye coordination and item control.

          Children need to develop both fine and gross motor skills to support independence. For example when using the toilet children will use gross motor skills to travel to the bathroom and fine motor skills to fasten clothing. 

          Children’s physical experiences outside of your setting will all be very different. It is important to remember that children will all develop at their own individual pace. As an early years practitioner, you will play an essential role in helping children to learn, develop and refine their physical skills.

          You can provide children with a range of opportunities to do this, through:
          - the curriculum you plan
          - the activities and environment you provide
          - being a good role model

          Babies and children will grow rapidly in the early years. 

          By 4 years old most children will have doubled in height from birth and will be developing their agility skills with confidence. This will all depend on the correct nutrition, sleep and opportunity to move and so it is important that you understand children’s expected development so that you are able to support each child appropriately.

          The first section of this module includes:

          - stages of physical development
          - theories and approaches relating to physical development   
          - factors affecting physical development

        heading: |
          Stages of physical development
        body: |
          Babies and children move through typical stages while developing their physical skills.

          Understanding these typical stages will help you to offer high quality care and identify physical needs.

          This topic includes:
          
          - fundamental motor skills
          - stages of development: at birth
          - stages of development: 0 to 6 months 
          - stages of development: 7 to 12 months 
          - stages of development: 13 to 24 months
          - stages of development: 25 to 36 months
          - stages of development: 37 to 48 months

          Fundamental motor skills
        body: |
          Fundamental motor skills are common movement skills that require children to be able to coordinate the movement of their feet, legs, trunk, arms and hands.

          Ofsted define fundamental motor skills as: “basic learned motor patterns that don’t occur naturally such as catching and balancing”.

          There are three categories of fundamental motor skills - manipulation, locomotor and stability.

          Manipulation skills support us to control objects. For example, throwing, catching, striking and bouncing.
          
          Locomotor skills include running, hopping, skipping, dodging, leaping, galloping, twisting, galloping and dodging.
          
          Stability skills are needed to control our body. These may include stopping, stretching, landing, twisting and climbing.

          These skills will be best developed from the age of three and it is essential that children have experienced lots of opportunities prior to this to learn and develop gross and fine motor skills that will provide the foundation for development. For example babies and young children will need to be able to develop their standing and walking skills to enable them to move to running with control and confidence.  

          There are also positive links between the acquisition of fundamental motor skills and confidence, cognitive development and communication. 

          Research shows that children are entering reception with lower levels of fundamental motor skills. This may be due to a decline in exercise and activity which is being replaced by screen time activities.

          Stages of physical development: at birth
        body: |
          Babies are born with a set of automatic and involuntary responses known as reflexes. These reflexes happen as a result of the baby being stimulated. For example if you put a clean finger in a baby’s mouth they will instinctively suck on it in response to the roof of their mouth being touched. This is the sucking reflex and is for feeding. This reflex develops from week 36 of pregnancy. Unlike other reflexes, it does not disappear as the baby grows. 

          Other reflexes which are usually present at birth include:

          ##Rooting reflex

          The rooting reflex works together with the sucking reflex to enable the baby to feed. They use this reflex to locate the nipple or teat. The rooting reflex is the involuntary response to the corner of the mouth being touched. For example, if you stroke a baby’s cheek they will move their head towards the touch. This reflex will usually disappear by 4 months old. 

          ##Moro reflex
          
          This is also known as the startle reflex as it is a baby’s involuntary response to being startled. This could be because of a loud noise, a sensation that they are falling or sudden movements. Babies will throw out their arms and legs before bringing their arms back across their bodies. This reflex will reduce and disappear once the baby's neck muscles are strong enough to support their head. This is usually from around 4 months of age.

          ##Palmar grasp reflex 
          
          This is where a baby’s finger or hand will curl around an item in response to something touching their palm. For example, if you touch a baby’s palm with your finger, they will curl their fingers around and hold onto your finger. This is a sign that the baby’s nervous system is functioning and developing. This reflex will usually disappear by 6 months old.

          ##Stepping reflex
          
          If a baby is held upright or so their feet are touching a surface, they raise and lower their feet in a walking motion. This is the beginning of leg muscle development and movement skills. This reflex will disappear by 2 to 3 months old. If this reflex is not present at birth it can cause neurological concerns.

          Stages of physical development: 0 to 6 months
        body: |
          A baby will grow and develop rapidly in the first 6 months of life. Most babies will progress from having no head or body control to being able to sit and interact with objects with control and purpose. A baby’s weight will typically double in the first 6 months. They will grow 1.5 to 2.5 centimetres in height each month.

          A child of this age will need between 14 to 16 hours of sleep in each 24 hour period. 8 to 10 of these hours will normally occur at night, with the rest taken as naps during the day. Some babies are born with teeth. Yet the most common age for teething is 6 months, with most babies showing at least their first tooth by 12 months. 

          During this period a baby will have been fed exclusively on milk. Weaning is when solid foods are introduced. This usually begins around 6 months old.


          As well as reflexes, other expected gross motor movements at 1 month old include:
          
          - the baby’s head flopping backwards if unsupported  
          - jerky body movements

          By 2 to 4 months old most babies will be able to:
          
          - make more controlled arm and leg movements 
          - lift their heads by 45 degrees during tummy time
          - maintain greater control of their heads

          By 4 to 6 months old most babies will be able to:
          
          - balance their head 
          - sit with support 
          - roll from their back to their front 
          - attempt to support their body when placed on their feet
          - make swimming actions when lying on their tummy
