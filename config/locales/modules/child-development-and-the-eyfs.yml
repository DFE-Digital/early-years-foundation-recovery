          You are supporting children to learn during the most crucial stage of their development. The choices you make and the curriculum you offer are vital to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential.

          Almost all children will experience the same developmental milestones. However, every child is unique. Children will develop at different rates, have different strengths and face different challenges. Each child’s development will have been shaped by their previous experiences. Acknowledging this will ensure you are able to support them effectively in the future.

          Understanding how children develop will enable you to meet the needs of all the children in your care.

          The modules included in this course will help you to understand how:

          - children develop
          - external factors, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, impact on child development
          - effective practice and use of the EYFS framework will support successful development

            <p class="govuk-body">As you travel through the course you will see practitioners prompts.</p>
          </div>

          These prompts are intended to:

          - encourage reflection on your current practice
          - introduce new strategies
          - reinforce effective teaching and learning
          - embed new knowledge

          Reflection is one of the most powerful tools you can use as a practitioner. In practice, you don't often have the time to stop and reflect. However, taking an opportunity to pause and think back can enable you to ask:

          - what had I intended?
          - did I successfully implement my intentions?
          - how do I know?
          - what impact did I see?
          - what would I do differently next time?

          As you reflect upon your practice, remember that no child should be considered as low ability. Every child can make progress as long as the correct support is implemented.

          In the same way that children develop holistically, you should approach the care you provide holistically. You will revisit key messages throughout the course to reinforce how different areas of development overlap.

          As an early years practitioner, it is crucial that you have a good understanding of children’s development. This will ensure that you are able to offer the high quality care that is required and expected. Parents will trust you and every child will thrive.

          This first section of the module includes:

          - the importance of understanding child development
          - factors affecting children's development

          Understanding how children develop will help you to plan and implement an early years curriculum that promotes inclusion and progress for all.

          This will reduce any opportunities for unnecessary barriers to learning and prevent any gaps in a child’s development.

          This topic includes:

          - how understanding child development benefits the child, practitioner and wider support network
          - the potential impact of limited child development knowledge
          - how improved child development knowledge supports outstanding practice including:
            - scaffolding learning
            - behaviour management
            - effective holistic support

          ##Increased resilience, confidence and self-efficacy
          
          Every child has the capability to be resilient, confident and to have self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the measure of whether a child feels they can succeed.

          Your knowledge of child development will help you to support children to develop these qualities.

          When you provide an enabling environment, children will experience:

          - problem solving opportunities
          - appropriate challenge
          - managed risk
          - opportunities to learn, rehearse and then remember new knowledge and skills
          
          This will help them to develop their resilience. Resilient children will approach activities and experiences with high self-efficacy and a strong “I can” attitude. Their exploration will help them to develop their knowledge and skills.

          ##Early help
          
          Your knowledge of child development will help you to plan an environment and curriculum that promotes success for all. You will be able to identify the correct level of support needed, adjust your approach and implement the appropriate level of early help.

          Early help can successfully:

          - minimise and remove the potential risk factors preventing children from achieving their full potential
          - reduce opportunities for children to become disengaged, isolated or withdrawn
          - reduce the time needed for children to become secure in their understanding and development
          - improve outcomes for children with effective integration of specialist support where appropriate
          
          ##A tailored experience
          
          Your knowledge and understanding of child development will help you offer each child a unique learning journey with improved outcomes.

          ##Supporting children to gain new knowledge
          
          Cognitive skills are the mental processes involved in learning and understanding things. If you understand how children learn concepts and skills, this will help you to support the children in your care to gain new knowledge.

          When you are planning your curriculum, you need to consider the intent, implementation and impact.

          $I
          "Intent is what you want pupils to learn: your curriculum thinking and high-level planning.
          
          Implementation is the teaching activities you choose to teach your curriculum.
          
          Impact is when that curriculum content is learned."

          [Ofsted, 2021](https://educationinspection.blog.gov.uk/2021/12/08/curriculum-keeping-it-simple/)
          $I

          When doing this planning, you need to consider each child's:

          - level of skill, knowledge and understanding
          - needs for successful learning to take place
          
          While all the children in your group may be of a similar age, this does not mean they will be at the same developmental level. You will need to call upon your knowledge of child development to consider different levels of secure knowledge and understanding.

          Some children may be in need of additional care, instruction and support, because of missing out on prior experiences. You’ll need to adapt your practice accordingly to ensure that these children receive the adult help needed to develop.

          You may need to differentiate activities to make an experience more simple, or adapt it to ensure that all members of the group are sufficiently challenged.

          Combining your professional judgment and knowledge of child development will help you to plan and put in place an early years curriculum that:

          - promotes inclusion and progress for all
          - reduces unnecessary barriers to learning

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Take a moment to think about the children you care for and pick a specific age group.</p>

          </div>

          Using your child development knowledge will help you to measure the impact of your intentions - has the child successfully learnt what you intended them to learn? Children need opportunities to reinforce their knowledge and learning. This ensures that they are secure in their level of understanding before being challenged to progress.

          Your knowledge of child development will support you to assess the correct secure age and stage for the child. It will also help you to offer the correct learning environment, experiences and opportunities to support their progress.

          Improving your knowledge of child development will help you to create and maintain positive partnerships with parents and others.

          ##Promoting positive relationships with parents
          
          The foundations of parent partnerships are built on trust. Demonstrating your knowledge of child development will give parents confidence in your ability to care for their child. Confident parents will be keen to share information and strategies with you. This will benefit both you and the child.

          It is crucial that you are able to have honest dialogue with parents to ensure they fully appreciate their child's needs. This includes when additional support is needed and how support can be given at home to enable their child to flourish.

          ##Effective multi agency working
          
          Your knowledge of child development will help you to identify where a child is not making progress and requires further support.

          You will be able to use this knowledge to implement policies and procedures and ensure that children are referred to the support needed and at the earliest point possible.

          Your knowledge of child development will help you to accurately fill out the required reports. This means the child will be offered appropriate support.

          ##A consistent approach
          
          There are many benefits to all practitioners within a setting having knowledge of child development.

          ###Consistent and shared best practice
          
          You will be able to help colleagues with your knowledge of how to support children of a variety of ages and stages. Sharing ideas between the team will reduce planning and resource creation.

          ###Maximum impact on development
          
          When all practitioners are focussed on supporting children’s development, you will be able to provide a highly effective environment, resources and experiences for every child. This will result in high quality care for all.

          ###Improved differentiation
          
          Greater awareness of child development, improved resource creation and shared workload will result in a broad range of opportunities.

          Limited knowledge of child development may lead to unintentional consequences for the children in your care.

          ##Incorrect level of challenge
          
          An incorrect level of challenge for children can be a contributing factor to their engagement and behaviour.

          When the environment and activities are not challenging enough, a child may complete tasks quickly or become bored. They may then start on an alternative task or entertain themselves with a destructive or distracting activity.

          When the environment and activities are too challenging, a child may become frustrated and disengaged if they do not understand expectations or are afraid of failure.

          Both situations lead to missed opportunities to learn, develop and thrive.

          ##Delayed support
          
          Incomplete knowledge of child development may prevent you from identifying where a child requires support in a particular area of development. This may delay them getting help early on.

          This could result in lost opportunities for children to learn and rehearse skills and affect a child’s understanding of behavioural expectations.

          Your knowledge of child development will help you to create and implement an effective curriculum. This reduces the gaps in learning and so removes the need for additional support.

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">

        heading: How improved child development knowledge supports outstanding practice - scaffolding learning
        body: |
          ![A baby stacking the sections of a rainbow model on top of each other.](/assets/1-1-1-5-1354999787.jpg)   
          
          With an identified starting point you will be able to effectively support children to build on existing learning. Imagine trying to do the simplest tasks without a set of instructions or any prior experience. This is how a child will feel if they are attempting a task that is simply too difficult or has not previously been experienced or explained. Your knowledge of child development will support you to follow a consistent process.

          To establish the starting point, you should consider the following.

          1. How old is the child and what is the relevant expected development?
          2. Is that child at that level yet?
          3. Does the child need you to start at a lower level of description or task, or has the child mastered that expectation?
          
          Now you have your starting foundation block to build upon.

          You can use your knowledge of child development to set the correct pace of learning and consider what you would like to aim towards next.

          Knowledge of children’s language and communication skills is also essential for successful scaffolding. Children may not holistically develop at the same rate and so may be at the expected level of development physically, but lack the language skills to interpret instructions. Therefore the child may experience difficulties with tasks intended to develop them physically if communication is challenging. It is crucial that you use a wide variety of activities to help the child develop their communication skills.

          Offering these temporary levels of successive support ensures that children develop the confidence and self belief needed to become secure in their knowledge and skills before becoming ready to attempt the next challenge.

        heading: How improved child development knowledge supports outstanding practice - understanding behaviour
        body: |
          ![Three young children playing with an outdoor water toy.](/assets/1-1-1-6-904506400.jpg)   
          
          Children can display challenging behaviour for a broad variety of reasons including:

          - being hungry
          - feeling unwell
          - feeling tired
          - learning difficulties or disabilities
          - not knowing the unspoken rules of friendly, respectful behaviour
          
          The learning environment can also offer potential triggers for unwanted behaviour. Your knowledge of child development will help you to avoid, minimise and resolve such incidents.

          ##Communication issues
          
          If instructions, activities and experiences are not tailored to a child’s needs or communication level, they may become frustrated. You can use your knowledge of child development to apply suitable strategies to avoid such frustrations and reduce lost learning time.

          ##Unsuitable activities and experiences
          
          If a child is not challenged by their environment, or feels a task is too difficult, they may want to avoid it and involve themselves in an alternative task. This may be unproductive or disruptive to others. You should provide a stage appropriate environment with managed risk and calculated challenge.

          ##Inconsistency
          
          For effective learning to take place children need to experience consistency regarding boundaries, routines and key people. These strategies need to be deployed to meet the child’s level of communication and cognitive skills to reap maximum benefits. A child who feels secure and understood will be free to explore and learn.

          Furthering your understanding of how patterns of development can influence the way children build relationships, develop their confidence and respond to strategies will help you support them by encouraging positive behaviour and promoting successful learning environments.

          ![Two young children crawling through large tubes as part of an obstacle course.](/assets/1-1-1-7-480953105.jpg)   
          
          All areas of child development are interconnected. Improving your knowledge of child development will help you to understand how progress in one area may be impacting or supporting progress for another.

          For example, for a child to actively engage in an obstacle course they will need to be able to:

          - understand and remember instructions
          - actively listen and process information
          - understand key physical movement names
          - develop balance, coordination and spatial awareness
          - comprehend the importance of turn taking where the activity involves a group
          - develop trust if the course includes challenge
          
          Being aware of expected milestones in all areas of development will ensure that opportunities and experiences are accessible to all children. It will also help you to identify where further support may be required in a particular area.

          There are many benefits to taking a holistic approach to learning and development.

          ##Encouraging curiousity
          
          Holistic learning encourages children to be curious as they consider concepts and topics from more than one perspective. A curious child will ask more questions, test more ideas and share their enthusiasm with others.

          ##Using children's interests
          
          You can use a child’s interests to encourage them to engage in areas that they may otherwise avoid. For example a child may dislike number, colour and shape, but will quickly become immersed in a dinosaur hunt that requires problem solving involving the same concepts. You can combine your knowledge of the individual child and your understanding of their developmental stage to help them thrive.

          Some children may not yet have developed particular interests, for example as a result of limited resources at home. You will need to ensure children can explore a wide variety of resources and experiences to support them to express their likes and dislikes.

          ##Meeting all the needs of a child
          
          Holistic learning ensures that the physical , emotional and psychological needs of a child are considered.

          Children will potentially experience a range of challenges and experiences that may impact on their development. However, this should not impact on their ability to succeed. Understanding these factors will help you to develop appropriate strategies and support mechanisms to guide children to reach their full potential.

          ![A young child holding a toy plane in the area and making plane noises with his mouth. A practitioner is looking up at him.](/assets/1-1-2-1-1129367033.jpg)             
          
          The long standing debate of nature versus nurture questions whether aspects of children’s development and behaviour are influenced more by biological (nature) or environmental (nurture) influences.

          The debate raises questions including:

          - how do we become the person we are?
          - are we born pre programmed to develop in a certain way despite environmental influences?
          - to what extent will our experiences and opportunities shape us?
          
          The children in your care will experience a broad range of influences that could potentially shape their learning and development. Some examples could include:

          - adverse experiences including violence and abuse
          - physical factors including housing conditions
          - financial factors - determining access to resources, activities and experiences
          - exposure and access to physical activity, adequate sleep and a healthy diet
          - family beliefs and culture
          - exposure to social interaction and communication
          - specialised knowledge - for example many children will know about dinosaurs because their parents or carers have shared this with them
          - having English as a second language
          - medical conditions or illnesses resulting in prolonged periods of missed learning
          - the impact of stereotypical views and discrimination
          - the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
          
          Your role is to ensure that any potential influences don’t become barriers and to ensure that every child has access to all learning and development opportunities.

          A robust understanding of children’s expected development will further support you to ensure that the choices you make as a practitioner and the quality of the environment that children experience will support children to progress and succeed.

        heading: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
        body: |
          Every child’s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have been different. It is likely that different areas of a child’s development may have been impacted positively or negatively during this time.

          You will also need to consider how characteristics of a child’s environment may have further magnified this impact. For example, some children will have had limited access to technology, books, outdoor space and a varied diet.

          ##Positive impact
          
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, some children may have spent extended periods with their parents and carers. They may have read more, had more conversations and increased their vocabulary through new hobbies.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Some children may not have had access to books or regular involvement in conversations, singing or opportunities to read. They may have had a smaller variety of social interactions and so less chances to learn and use new vocabulary.

          Some children may have spent extended periods experiencing inappropriate behaviour, such as inappropriate language from older siblings. They may now have difficulty improving their behaviour and understanding why they need to do so.

          ##Positive impact
          
          Some children with access to technology may have played with number related apps and games. They may also have been involved in practical activities such as cookery requiring them to weigh and measure.

          Children may have had access to toys, games and jigsaws that require problem solving and matching. They may have explored mathematical concepts such as time, shape and distance through interactions with their parents or carers.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Some children may not have had access to toys, games or learning experiences that supported their mathematical understanding. A lack of social interaction may have resulted in limited opportunities to explore mathematical concepts such as time, shape and distance.

          Some parents may have a limited understanding of how to support their child with maths and what their child should be learning. They may have avoided this subject and focused on other activities.

          ##Positive impact
          
          Some children with access to outside space and opportunities to go out may have spent more of their day outside. They may have explored more or learned a new skill such as riding a bike or scooter.

          If children have older siblings they may have spent a lot of time doing challenging physical activities where they copied their siblings’ behaviour. They may have developed skills they otherwise might not have been exposed to.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Some children may have had restricted access or opportunity for physical activity and outdoor space. This may have resulted in reduced movement. Children who have been able to take extended naps and periods of rest may now lack the stamina needed to complete a day in a chilcare setting.

          Where parents have worked from home, children may have spent more time watching TV or playing on tablets or games consoles to maintain their interest. This will have resulted in prolonged periods of inactivity.

          ##Positive impact

          Some children with access to technology, books and adult interaction may have benefitted from extended periods of online exploration and discussion. They may have had opportunities to get involved in family projects such as growing vegetables or learning about fixing household items.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Some children may have had limited opportunities to participate in day trips and travel, and so less chance to experience new environments. They may have spent longer periods of time staying inside their home, possibly with use of a garden.

          ##Positive impact
          
          Some children may have become more resilient regarding how to maintain communication with others, how to support those around them and how to manage uncertainty. Some children who have had the freedom to explore existing interests and knowledge, with limited or no expectation of outcome, may now have increased imagination.

          Some children who have had opportunity to express and discuss their feelings associated with the pandemic may now have emotional maturity.

          Some children who have spent more time with parents, carers and older siblings may have benefited from increased reinforcement of positive behaviours, rules and routines modelled to them, for example appropriate table manners.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Limited opportunities to interact with others, particularly those unfamiliar to children, may have impacted on children’s confidence. Children may now have increased anxieties and concerns surrounding cleanliness, illness and safety, resulting in difficulties engaging and concentrating. They may have experienced an increase in stressful situations such as financial difficulties.

          Staying at home means children may have lost opportunities to experience social etiquette, for example in restaurants. They may also have had limited opportunities to learn, rehearse and develop social skills such as turn taking and sharing.

          ##Positive impact

          Some children with increased exposure to technology will have developed new skills. Children with access to the outdoors, creative materials and imaginary play will have used their imagination and creativity.

          Children may have had increased opportunities to listen to music, sing, dance or participate in other creative activities with parents and carers or siblings. As a result they may have developed new skills.

          ##Negative impact
          
          Some children will have had limited exposure to dance, music and art. Children with limited or no access to creative materials, role play items or musical activity may have limited skills and development in these areas.

          As one of the 3 prime areas of the EYFS, communication and language development provides the essential foundations for all areas of learning.

          If a child is not currently at the expected level of communication development, but is expected to participate at that level, the consequences will be seen across all areas of development.

          Throughout all the modules within this course you will continually consider how a child’s ability to understand information, express themselves and communicate their needs will impact on their overall holistic development and interactions.

          You must remember that communication is not just verbal. Children will also be supported and influenced by non verbal communication including eye contact, facial expressions, body language, gestures and written forms of communication.

          Effective communication skills will support children to:

          - create and maintain relationships
          - feel valued and important
          - express their individual needs and preferences
          - increase resilience and self efficacy
          - manage their behaviour
          
          Research demonstrates proven links between positive early childhood language experiences and outcomes in later life.

          You can support children’s communication and language skills in a number of ways including:

          - creating a language rich environment
          - modelling positive behaviour
          - providing learning opportunities

          ##Language rich environments
          
          A successful language rich environment will provide children with opportunities to hear language, see language and test their language skills without fear.

          Examples of successful language rich environments include opportunities to:

          - be quiet and process information, for example by reading alone or carrying out individual tasks
          - read and comprehend, using labelled display boards and resources, story corners, activity instructions or cookery recipes
          - interact, talk, or read books with others
          - engage in imaginative play, like role play
          - be musical, including listening to music and singing
          
          Your knowledge of children’s language and communication development will help you provide an environment that contains experiences, resources and activities that can challenge every child.

          ##Being a positive role model
          
          As a practitioner you join other influential adults in the child’s life as an important and essential role model for communication. The environment you provide and the language you model will be reflected in the skills that children develop.

          You can help children to develop secure attachments with you. This means they will have trust and confidence in you, allowing you to be an effective role model. The brain development module explores the role of attachment in further detail.

          Your actions will be a continuous and important source of influence. Children will observe:

          - how you interact with others
          - how characters interact with each other in the stories you read to them
          
          Children will copy these interactions as they develop and test their own communication. This also impacts on the child’s social skills. For example, if a child observes a positive interaction between yourself and their parent they may mimic the interaction they have observed.

          Ensuring children have opportunities to speak and feel that they are being heard will impact on children’s confidence, self-esteem and self-worth. Use active listening to help children feel that they are being heard.

          Hearing repetitive language such as routine instruction, praise or general comments, for example “your turn, my turn”, will provide increased opportunities for children to learn, rehearse and develop their communication skills.

          It is essential that you are using the correct names and words for items and actions, using correct pronunciation and avoiding the use of slang or abbreviations as children will easily become confused or frustrated if they do not understand.

          Promoting positive handling and use of resources such as books and including them in the daily routine will help children to understand their importance and encourage further independent exploration.

          To support children to reach their potential you will need to have high expectations for each and every child in your care. You will recognise that every child deserves to have an equal chance at success.

          Whilst it is essential that we acknowledge impacting factors such as difficult life experiences, an identified SEND or being from a disadvantaged background, these factors should not be seen as barriers to success but as an opportunity to offer tailored support.

          This topic includes:

          - acknowledging children’s individual strengths
          - empowering children
          - supporting individual potential
          - successful enabling environments
          - a balanced approach to learning:
            - child led play
            - adult led activities

          All children will have their individual strengths. Sometimes a child’s strength is obvious, such as when they excel in a particular subject or area of development. At other times the strength can be harder to see but is just as valuable, such as being a critical thinker.

          Some children will need you to create opportunities for them to develop a strength. This creates a valuable opportunity for them to be praised and acknowledged and will encourage the development of strengths in other areas.

          In your setting, you should embrace aspects of children’s personalities as their personal strengths.

          Recognising and acknowledging a child’s individual strengths will be powerful in supporting children to develop confidence, resilience and self-efficacy and will impact on how they approach their learning and development.

          Having an awareness and understanding of a child’s personalities, talents and abilities will make the child feel valued and important which will support higher self-efficacy. While it is important that you do not restrict learning and development to these preferred areas, they can be used to promote holistic development by encouraging children to engage and build confidence across the whole curriculum. This will support them to tackle less familiar or more challenging tasks.

          High self-efficacy will support a child’s enthusiasm and desire in all areas of development and will be an essential support strategy when tackling difficult concepts and activities.

          It is important to recognise and celebrate children’s accomplishments. Even where the accomplishment might be considered small it is essential that the child feels recognised for their achievement. This will encourage children to attempt more challenging tasks even when there is an opportunity for them to make a mistake, as they will seek that acknowledgement again.

          All children will have strengths and it is important to embrace and celebrate those individual strengths. This will positively support them and empower them to develop self-worth, self-respect and confidence.

      1-2-1-2:
        heading: Empowering children
        body: |     
          ![A child sat in a vegetable garden, pulling up a carrot.](/assets/1-2-1-2-937138126.jpg)             
          
          A key part of your role as a practitioner is to empower children. Empowering children will positively support their confidence, self-worth, self-respect, self-regulation and their overall health and wellbeing. As an early years practitioner your choices and practices will impact upon the empowerment of children.

          Having a positive attitude and approach and leading by example is essential to help develop a positive attitude to learning. This will encourage enthusiasm and motivation, resulting in increased engagement and a passion for learning new skills and knowledge.

          You can help to empower children by:

          - giving appropriate responsibility
          - building trusting relationships
          - allowing children to experience managed risk
          
          ##Giving children responsibility
          
          All children, including those with SEND, can be given responsibility appropriate to their individual level of development.

          Giving children responsibility will provide them with the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from their responses which will support further resilience. Responsibility will often also offer opportunity for children to be involved in decision making and to develop an understanding of the consequences associated with their actions. This will ensure that every child has received the necessary skills and preparation to adapt to the need for responsibility in later life.

          ##Building trusting relationships
          
          Building trusting relationships with the children in your care will support them to feel confident and relaxed within the setting. This will enable the children to concentrate on the experiences and opportunities available without worry or hesitation. We will continue to consider the impact and importance of positive relationships throughout the training.

          ##Experiencing managed risk
          
          You will already understand the importance of not putting children in dangerous situations, however it is essential that children experience managed risk. For children to become self reliant in later life they will need to understand how to keep themselves well, healthy and safe.

          Using a balanced approach and supporting children to understand the consequences of actions (such as throwing sand or climbing on a low wall without caution) will ensure that learning activities and experiences do not need to be restricted but approached with care.

          It is essential that you appreciate a child’s level of understanding and comprehension to make sure that you are giving clear instructions for using equipment safely.

          A confident and empowered child will be well equipped to succeed both now and in the future.

          $I

          To successfully empower and support children to progress you will need to start from the foundation of what children know and can do already.

          This starting point will be different for every child. Children should not be disadvantaged because they have a different starting point to others or because you do not know what that starting point is.

          You should find out about the child’s home life, previous experiences, preferences and interests. You should then decide how the care you provide and the learning environment offered by the setting can compliment this.

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

          </div>
          
          When you are able to successfully identify individual children’s starting points you can stop potential gaps in learning from opening or widening further by giving the correct support.

          The remainder of this module will consider how using your professional judgement and child development knowledge can ensure that this support is accessible through enabling environments and implementation of the EYFS.

          Children are constantly learning and require an ambitious curriculum that gives them the opportunity to make sense of their thoughts and experiences and considers their:

          - identity and culture
          - interests and learning needs
          - individual communication needs
          - previous experiences
          
          Children’s learning and development opportunities will be maximised in environments that are varied, that offer challenge with minimised risk and where children are protected from harm and abuse.

          Here are some other key characteristics of enabling environments.

          ##A welcoming environment that provokes thought and imagination
          
          An environment that is bright, colourful and contains items familiar from home will be appealing and will offer children a sense of comfort. Having a set routine will support children to feel secure and settle into learning without being worried about what might happen next. As always, it is important that children’s individual needs are taken into consideration. For example where children may become overwhelmed by vivid decoration, calmer more neutral areas will be needed.

          ##Resources, activities and experiences that celebrate individuality
          
          Children will feel valued, important and comfortable in an environment that reflects their gender, race, culture, interests and level of development. This can be applied throughout the setting. Examples could include books, jigsaws, dressing up clothing, utensils, display boards, outings, learning and development topics, rhymes and songs, visitors or food.

          ##Access to outdoor environments
          
          Often children feel a greater sense of freedom outdoors which leads to greater use of imagination.

          Outdoor areas will provide children with further opportunity to experience activities to rehearse, explore and develop knowledge and understanding of the world, creativity and imagination. Activities could include mud kitchens, grow your own and caring for animals.

          Outdoor environments often give children a greater opportunity to develop gross motor skills. In your setting, you could give children the option to participate in obstacle courses and access equipment such as bikes, balls, trampolines, slides or climbing apparatus.

          Not all children have access to outdoor space on a regular basis at home and so you should maximise opportunities to encourage physical exercise within the setting.

          ##A balance of familiar and new
          
          Children will benefit from the familiarity of routine and an environment that has been well planned to include key features such as dedicated areas for reading, creativity and role play. Children will then need to be challenged through the introduction of new and unfamiliar items, for example those relating to unfamiliar countries or festivals.

          Children will need access to familiar and consistent activities that support them to secure knowledge and skills and then the introduction of challenge or unfamiliar activities and resources to support development.

          ##A secure emotional environment
          Children will thrive in an environment where they:

          - feel safe to express themselves
          - understand the consistent response to their behaviour
          - have built secure and trusting relationships
          
          The stability of routine and familiarity discussed previously will further reinforce children’s confidence and enable to them to participate in learning without hesitance or concern.

          ##An accessible environment for all
          
          Your environment can help children build independence through choice and responsibility. In your setting you should provide an environment where they are able to initiate child led activities and become actively involved in tidying and maintaining the environment.

          Some children may be more reserved. This could be for a number of reasons including shyness or as a result of SEND. It is crucial that all children are supported to engage in the environment and suitable strategies could include:

          - 1:1 or small group work
          - increased reassurance
          - identified quiet areas
          - using a child’s interests to encourage engagement
          - use of activities to encourage social skills and friendships including shared reading and role play puppets
          - building self esteem through praise and reward

          ![Two young children playing together outside.](/assets/1-2-1-5-140457067.jpg)             
          
          There are extensive benefits associated with both child led and adult led activity in an early years setting. The key is to use your professional judgement and child development knowledge to strike the correct balance to ensure the benefits are maximised for each child.

          $I
          “Children need opportunities to develop their own play and independent exploration. This is enjoyable and motivating. They also need adults to ‘scaffold’ their learning by giving them just enough help to achieve something they could not do independently.”

          Development Matters, 2021
          $I

          There are many benefits to child led play.

          ##Imagination and creativity
          
          When a child has chosen the activity, task or experience they will often feel in control of its outcome. Where the activity does not involve adult interaction, children will often feel more freedom to trial new ideas without any expectation. This often leads to increased imagination and creativity. The chosen activities are also not necessarily reality bound allowing children the freedom to test out ideas or process thoughts.

          ##Increased concentration
          
          Often children will become fully immersed in activities and tasks they have initiated themselves as they are likely to be built upon their interests or something that has encouraged their curiosity. This can lead to longer periods of engagement and deeper understanding of a topic.

          ##Increased communication
          
          A child will often feel more confident within an activity or task they have instigated themselves. The activity is also more likely to be based on an interest in which they are more knowledgeable. These factors will often result in increased conversation, activity commentary and spontaneous comment.

          ##Independence
          
          When a child feels completely at ease they are more likely to attempt an activity or task independently without worrying about the outcome. This often leads to the development or improvement of new skills and knowledge resulting in increased independence.

          ##Emotional development
          
          Children can use these opportunities to explore their feelings through imaginative play such as role play opportunities. Imaginative play gives them the freedom to experiment and explore while keeping full control over the outcomes.

          ##Social development
          
          Children can use these opportunities to navigate social skills such as sharing, turn taking and negotiating the views of others with minimal intervention from practitioners. This can successfully support children to develop deeper understanding and encourage them to test and practice new skills.

          We can learn a lot about a child’s health, wellbeing and development from watching them during child led activity as they feel empowered to express themselves freely.

          ##Limitations of child led activity
          
          There are, of course, also limitations to child led activity. Children will often, if not always, lean towards their preferred activities and interests and often use skills they already feel confident in.

          If left to only participate in child led play, over prolonged periods, gaps in learning and development may open or widen.

          Limited adult led activity and formative assessment opportunities will also cause delays in identifying and supporting these gaps.

        body: |   
          ![A practitioner talking to a group of young children. ](/assets/1-2-1-6-182904187.jpg)             
          
          Now, let's consider the benefits of adult led activities.

          ##Enhanced opportunities to develop speech and language
          
          Adult participation will increase the opportunity for children to benefit from:

          - hearing correct pronunciation
          - increased eye contact
          - modelled behaviour such as use of tone, volume and speed
          
          ##Boundaries and expectations
          
          Having a practitioner present within an activity will support children to understand and keep to rules, boundaries and social expectations. Setting and promoting rules and boundaries will provide routine and security which will positively support children’s mental health and wellbeing. It will also support them to develop the necessary social skills needed throughout life.

          ##Opportunities for learning
          
          Adult led activities will have been planned for a specific reason or outcome. As a result of formative assessment you will know where children would benefit from further learning and will plan accordingly. When done effectively this will still offer opportunity to incorporate children’s interests and preferences to encourage engagement and enthusiastic interaction.

          ##Guaranteed inclusion
          
          Practitioner presence within an activity will ensure that all children can be actively involved. This will be because you have differentiated the activity. You can make sure all children are engaged in conversation opportunities. Across a planned period of time all children will be encouraged to participate.

          ##Scaffolded learning
          
          Practitioner presence will ensure that you are able to support children through tasks that are unfamiliar to them to support confidence and build knowledge and understanding. When children are secure in their knowledge and understanding you can then begin to scaffold their understanding of the next level. Often children will practice the skills you are scaffolding within their child led activities.

          A balanced approach is essential to ensure that children have opportunity to play, learn and explore both indoor and outdoor environments.

          Your professional judgment, knowledge of individual children and understanding of children’s development will support you to ensure that the choices you make within your environment will promote success for all children.

        body: |   
          When implemented effectively, the mandatory EYFS framework will ensure that all children are kept safe and healthy in an inclusive environment that promotes independence and ensures that no child gets left behind.

          This topic includes:

          - an effective EYFS
          - effective assessment

      1-2-2-1:
        heading: An effective EYFS
        body: |   
          ![Two young children and an early years practitioner building a structure with plastic blocks.](/assets/1-2-2-1-1093505048.jpg)             
          
          Using the 7 areas of learning within the EYFS to shape the learning programmes experienced by children will naturally encourage you to focus on holistic development and promote progress.

          Further focus on the prime areas will put language at the heart of the curriculum and place emphasis on physical development and personal, social and emotional development (PSED).

          Critically, effective implementation of the EYFS, combined with professional judgement and child development knowledge, will stop gaps from opening or widening any further as it strives to offer benefits to all children.

          ##How the EYFS benefits children
            
          ###Quality and consistency
            
          The use of the areas of learning and development will offer all children quality and consistency as they work towards the skills and knowledge required by the academic year in which they turn 5. Effective implementation of the framework will therefore ensure that regardless of setting type, location or prior experience every child receives the same high standard of care. Using your knowledge of children’s development will further support you to ensure that learning and development is tailored to meet individual needs.

          ###A secure foundation
            
          Effective implementation of the framework will ensure that learning is planned to build upon a strong starting point. Children need opportunities to reinforce understanding and secure the foundation knowledge needed to build upon. An understanding of child development will support you to recognise the foundations needed at each age and stage and prepare for the next appropriate steps.

          ###Partnership working
            
          Using your understanding of children’s development will further support effective implementation of the framework as positive partnerships with parents, carers, colleagues and other professionals are promoted. The framework provides consistency between internal and external professionals as everyone works towards the same expectation.

          Effective communication with parents about your implementation of the EYFS will promote the consistency between learning both at home and in the setting. Parents and carers undoubtedly know the most about the child’s past experiences and current starting point. Encouraging and implementing information sharing and then, most importantly, effectively utilising information is essential to support progress for all children.

          ###Equality of opportunity
            
          Every child is entitled to access to a full and an unedited curriculum that celebrates their abilities and nurtures their individual development.

          The EYFS requires practitioners to work in partnership with parents to ensure that every child receives an inclusive curriculum that is free of discriminatory practice and supports success for all.

          We know that all children will potentially face a range of environmental and biological influences that will need to be considered when meeting their learning and development needs. It is crucial that we identify SEND early to prevent gaps in learning opening or widening further. Research shows us that children from disadvantaged areas will typically be approximately 4 months behind peers when they start their reception year.

          Successful assessment will be key to effectively supporting you to identify children’s starting points and planning appropriate environments and experiences to support progress.

          Effective assessment should:

          - not take practitioners away from children for prolonged periods
          - be well planned
          - clearly inform practitioners about next steps
          
          A robust understanding of children’s development will be essential to support you to clearly identify the correct opportunities and experiences needed to promote progress without overwhelming children or allowing learning gaps to widen.

          Ongoing formative assessment is crucial to support you to continually identify what knowledge and skills a child has secured, what they are still developing and what their next steps need to be.It is important to avoid focussing on an assumed ticklist of behaviours and qualities and instead concentrate on individual progress in relation to a child’s unique characteristics. This will ensure that support is offered to all children and not just the most advantaged.

          Understanding how to adapt the learning environment and to identify potential SEND needs will also be critical. You will be able to continually tailor environments, experiences and activities through successful intent and implementation.

          The observation checkpoint prompts found in Development Matters will support you to carry out formative assessment opportunities in relation to each of the areas of learning and identify relevant strengths and areas for development.

          The opportunity for summative assessment at the 2 year check provides you with opportunities to reinforce our full understanding of a child’s level of knowledge and understanding and work in partnership with parents to support development.

          While the 2 year check will be a written summary of the child’s progress in the 3 prime areas of the EYFS, you can use your knowledge to give parents and carers a more detailed understanding of their child’s progress.

          Regardless of individual characteristics, previous experience or potential barriers to learning every child is unique and has the potential to be capable, resilient and successful.

          All children have a right to access high quality early education and as a practitioner you have a responsibility to provide an enabling environment that is:

          - stage appropriate
          - rich in language
          - diverse in experience and resource
          - consistent
          - child led
          - scaffolded by adult guidance
          - responsive
          
          Without knowledge of the expected stages of development and knowledge of your individual children it will be difficult to provide the correct environment necessary for success.

          The remaining modules within this course will support you to further develop your understanding and practice. Make sure you sign up to hear when new modules become available.
