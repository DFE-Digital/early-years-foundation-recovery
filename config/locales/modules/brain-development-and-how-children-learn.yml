          On completion of this module, you will be able to:

          - establish and explore the stages of children’s brain development
          - explore the impact of brain development on children’s holistic development
          - examine the connection between brain development and children’s learning
          - explore a range of theories underpinning best practice

          Brain development is a long process which can be impacted by both genetic and environmental factors. As an early years practitioner, understanding the developmental patterns and factors that can affect children’s brain development will help you to best support them to grow and learn.

          As communication and language will underpin all other areas of development, it is essential that we promote both brain and communication development.

        heading: The developing brain
        body: |
          From birth to 5 years old, a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life. In fact, 90% of brain development occurs during this time.

          The first section of this module includes:

          -	brain development before birth
          - Piaget’s theory of cognitive development from 0 to 5 years
          - factors affecting brain development
      2-1-1:

        body: |
          Babies’ brain development is a complex process that starts at around 2 weeks after conception and continues throughout pregnancy.

          This topic includes:

          - parts of the brain
          - brain development before birth
          - influences on brain development before birth

          ##Brain stem

          The brain stem is at the top of your spinal cord where your head joins your neck. This is the most developed section of your brain at birth. This vital part of the brain controls your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. It also supports newborn reflexes such as crying, startling and sucking.

          ##Cerebellum

          The cerebellum is at the back of your head. This is the area in charge of motor development. It controls balance and coordinates movements. The cerebellum combines the signals from the eyes, ears and muscles with motor commands. This area of the brain supports babies to progress with motor skills such as the progression from rolling to crawling to walking. Repeating challenging activities helps this area of the brain to develop.

          ##Frontal lobes

          The frontal lobes are located behind your forehead and are the largest part of your brain. They are involved in:

          - moral reasoning
          - critical thinking
          - planning ahead
          - decision making
          - impulse control

          The frontal lobes continue to develop until you are in your twenties or thirties. They are shaped by your experiences and environment.

          ##Occipital lobes

          The occipital lobes are the back part of the brain. They allow us to make sense of information that comes from our eyes.

          At birth, the neural pathways used to carry the information from the eyes to the brain are not fully developed. Babies can only see 20 to 30 cm in front of them. To develop these neural pathways babies need to use them, and they can do this by looking at a variety of objects. Babies’ vision improves steadily, and by 8 months they will see almost as well as an adult.

          ##Temporal lobes

          The temporal lobes are at the side of your brain, just above your ears. One of their important functions is to help us understand and process sounds. Other functions include recognising faces and objects, as well as memory acquisition.

          It’s essential that a child is exposed to a wide variety of visual, auditory and practical stimuli that enable them to test concepts and build memory skills.

          To support children, you can:

          - sing songs and rhymes
          - encourage discussion and asking questions
          - share stories
          - use visual aids, such as puppets and story sacks
          - go on sensory walks
          - support creative activities that use a wide varieties of textures and colours

          ##Parietal lobes

          The parietal lobes are located behind the frontal lobes and above the temporal lobes. One of their main functions is to make sense of things we touch. They also tell us where our body is in relation to objects around us.

          ![A baby in the womb, showing that a lot of brain development has already taken place before birth](/assets/2-1-1-2a-952888766.jpg)

          ##First trimester: 1 to 12 weeks

          The neural plate - which is the basis of the nervous system - starts to form around 2 weeks after conception. It will grow longer and longer until it becomes the neural tube at approximately 5 weeks. At 6 weeks, the tube closes to become the brain and spinal cord.

          When the tube does not successfully close and is left exposed to amniotic fluid, neural tube defects such as spina bifida can occur.

          In this first trimester, the brain will grow millions of neurones. A neurone is a nerve cell. It carries electrical impulses from one part of the body to another to transmit information.

          The first electrical activity in the brain starts at 8 weeks. This means the baby will begin to spontaneously move in the womb.

          ##Second trimester: 13 to 26 weeks

          The brain develops rapidly during the second trimester.

          The brainstem will coordinate practice breaths as it directs compression of the chest muscles and movement of the diaphragm.

          Movement will become more coordinated with increased kicking and stretching. The brainwaves that occur during sleep form by 28 weeks and the baby will start to experience sleep cycles. The brain stem is almost fully developed by the end of the second trimester.

          ##Third trimester: 27 to 40 weeks

          A baby’s brain triples in weight during the third trimester. During this time, a fatty substance called myelin begins to coat the neurones. This is called myelination and it increases the speed at which electrical impulses can travel.

          ##Ongoing development

          After birth, when a baby repeats and practises a skill, it leads to further myelination of the neurones involved. This improves the speed at which the message travels and so improves the skill.

          The brain will also get rid of old unused neurone pathways. It’s important for children to experience a wide variety of opportunities so that their neurones develop.

      2-1-1-3a:
        heading: Influences on brain development before birth
        body: |
          There are a variety of influences and complications that can impact on brain development before birth.

          ##Illness in pregnancy

          When pregnant women have certain infections or illnesses during pregnancy, it can impact on their babies’ brain development. If a woman experiences chicken pox or measles during her pregnancy, it can lead to her baby having limb and brain abnormalities. In a very small number of cases, if a mother experiences pre-eclampsia, it can result in severe complications for the baby.

          ##Smoking in pregnancy

          If a mother smokes during pregnancy, this increases the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. Cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen the baby receives and reduces the forming of neurones. This can result in an underdeveloped brain.

          ##Diet

          When a pregnant mother’s diet does not cover the energy needs of both mother and baby, this can lead to poor brain development. Taking folic acid supplements and eating foods rich in omega 3 can support brain development.

          ##Drinking alcohol in pregnancy

          Current NHS guidance is for a mother to avoid alcohol while pregnant. When a pregnant mother drinks alcohol it passes through the placenta to the baby. The liver is one of the last organs to fully develop. This means a baby will struggle to process the alcohol. This results in an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth and developmental damage.

          If a mother drinks while pregnant, their child may be born with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). This can lead to issues for the child with:

          - speech and communication
          - learning and development
          - managing their emotions
          - developing social skills

          ##Complications during labour

          Any complications during labour that result in prolonged periods of oxygen deprivation for the baby can result in brain injury. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy affects around 3 in 1,000 births and can result in disabilities and death.

      2-1-1-4a:
        heading: How communication develops before birth
        body: |
          ![A baby in the womb, showing connections developing in the brain](/assets/2-1-1-4a-930275946.jpg)

          Babies’ ears usually develop at 20 weeks of pregnancy. By 24 weeks, their hearing is developed and they can hear sounds from within the womb.

          By the end of the second trimester, a baby can detect loud noises outside of the womb. They will turn their head towards the sounds they hear. They will also begin to recognise their mother’s voice. Hearing both male and female voices helps babies to understand different tones.

          Talking to an unborn baby can:

          - relax them
          - promote the bond between them and their parents and carers
          - support positive social and emotional development after birth

          Babies can remember sounds they experienced within the womb. After birth, they can often be calmed by music that they heard regularly during pregnancy.

          In the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, a baby can begin to absorb language.

          Communication with an unborn child also supports other areas of development. For example, as the baby moves around in response to detecting sound, they exercise the neurones associated with movement skills. This encourages further neurone connections and leads to more coordinated movements.

        heading: Piaget’s theory of cognitive development from 0 to 5 years
        body: |
          From birth to 5 years a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life.
          90% of a child’s brain development will take place during this period.
          The early years are the period when more and more connections develop in the brain.
          This means a child can carry out more complex tasks.

          This topic includes:

          - brain development from 0 to 2 years old: the sensorimotor stage
          - brain development from 2 to 5 years old: the preoperational stage
          - recent updates to Piaget’s theories

          ![A seated baby playing with finger puppets](/assets/2-1-2-1a-625863974.jpg)

          This section of the module looks at Piaget’s theory of cognitive development.
          Originally published in 1936, Piaget’s theory is still influential in some practice today.

          It’s important to remember that theory is just that: theoretical ideas based on the research of an individual. Much the same as no one activity will suit the needs of all children, no one theory will influence how you support a child.

          It is also important to fully consider criticisms of the theory and the findings from more recent research.

          Later in this module we will look at a wider range of theories that further explore the social and behavioural influences on development, and consider their relevance within your practice

          ## Piaget's theory

          Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who carried out research into children’s cognitive development. Piaget concluded that children travel through 4 distinct stages.

          Piaget’s research showed that babies' development started with a set of reflexes and travelled through a series of stages until children had developed more advanced skills.

          Piaget labelled the 0 to 2 years old stage of development as the sensorimotor stage. In this stage, babies use their senses to explore and grow.

          Piaget did not believe that babies were born with a fixed intellectual ability. Instead, he said that a child’s interaction with their environment, combined with their growing brain, shapes the development of their cognitive skills.

          Cognitive skills are the mental processes involved in learning and understanding things. This includes:

          - thinking
          - knowing
          - remembering
          - judging
          - problem solving

          Piaget believed that babies and young children need time and positive experiences to encourage the use of senses and to practise actions. This then supports the development of thinking and skills.

          Piaget’s thoughts also included the idea that babies in the sensorimotor stage lacked the skill of object permanence. Object permanence is the ability to mentally picture an item even when it was no longer there.

          Piaget made connections between object permanence and separation anxiety which babies generally experience until around 9 to 10 months. During this time, babies do not yet understand that their carer still exists, even when they are out of sight.

          Jean Piaget also believed that children:

          - could learn just as effectively on their own without the influence of an adult
          - have an internal motivation to learn
          - do not always follow the same predictable development path

          Piaget’s work resulted in a number of early years approaches including:

          - the importance of a supportive environment
          - the promotion of social interaction and peer teaching
          - that children need opportunities to test inconsistencies in their thoughts

      2-1-2-2:
        heading: |
          Brain development from 2 to 5 years old: the preoperational stage
        body: |
          Piaget believed that at around the age of 2 children moved from the sensorimotor to the preoperational stage.

          He thought this stage begins as a child starts to use words and symbolic thinking. Symbolic thinking means thinking about people, places and events which are not present. For example, in imaginative play a child might use a brush as a horse.

          During this time, children develop both short and long term memory and the ability to focus.

          Piaget believed that at the beginning of this stage, children have difficulty understanding things from another person's point of view. This is known as egocentrism. Being egocentric makes it difficult to reason with children as they believe everyone sees things the same way that they do.

          ##Schemas

          Piaget suggested that the child’s intellectual development journey involves building a network of mental structures which he referred to as schemas. For example, a child will build a schema for a horse. They will picture a horse as a 4 legged animal that has a tail and mane.

          ![A diagram showing a child's schema of a horse as an animal with 4 legs, a tail and a mane](/assets/schema-horse.jpg)

          Piaget stated that children then use 2 processes to shape and change their schemas - assimilation and accommodation.

          ##Assimilation

          Assimilation is the process through which children make sense of the world around them by applying what they know. For example, initially anything else that a child sees that fits this horse schema will also be known as a horse. So if a child sees a zebra - with 4 legs, a tail and a mane - their instinct may be to call it a horse.

          This is because they will have already seen horses or pictures of horses and will make the connection that this is a different coloured horse.

          ![A diagram showing how a child applies their schema of a horse to a zebra - both have a mane, a tail and 4 legs](/assets/assimilation-zebra.jpg)

          ##Accommodation

          Accommodation is where children shape their ideas and make changes to their understanding with the acquisition of new knowledge. In this example, the child will receive input from an adult, activity or experience that introduces the concept of a zebra, and that a zebra has stripes. The child can now use the knowledge to develop their schema to realise that not all large 4 legged animals are horses.

          ![A diagram showing how a child updates their schema of a horse. This animal has a mane, a tail and 4 legs, but no stripes. Therefore it is not a zebra but a horse.](/assets/horse-accommodation.jpg)

          This links with the thought that children need new experiences to extend their knowledge. However it is important to remember that children will need to be secure in their foundations and accommodation can be supported effectively through scaffolding.

          Recent research supports these ideas.

          You can support children in this stage by providing an enabling environment that gives children:

          - high quality adult interactions
          - adult led activity to provide strong foundations to learning
          - the freedom to explore and test their ideas and understanding
          - the opportunity for practitioners to support when learning becomes overwhelming or if they need further help

      2-1-2-3a:
        heading: Recent updates to Piaget’s theory
        body: |
          ![A practitioner and a young child playing with a musical toy](/assets/2-1-2-3a-1158972312.jpg)

          In the years that followed Piaget’s work, large numbers of studies and experiments were carried out which supported and reinforced his findings.

          However, more recent research also shows some criticisms and questions regarding Piaget’s work.

          Examples have been documented of babies having the ability to show surprise and look for things that have disappeared from their environment, suggesting that they can have the expectation that an object continues to exist even though they can no longer see it.

          This would suggest that babies and young children have some ability to form abstract thoughts which is contradictory to Piaget’s previous thoughts.

          Piaget’s research was also criticised for not taking into account a wide variety of socio-economic factors within the environment as much of his research was conducted with children of well educated professionals. Piaget’s theory also does not give consideration to how the stages of development may be influenced by individual characteristics such as culture or gender. However neither of these factors should provide barriers to children’s learning as all children's needs must be acknowledged and met.

          Some current research has found that babies and young children learn through a combination of sensorimotor activities like using their senses to explore their environment and the opportunity to build upon previous experiences and opportunities. This supports Piaget’s thoughts regarding the importance of the environment and a child’s ability to explore using their senses.

      2-1-3:
        heading: Factors affecting brain development
        body: |
          Children will experience a wide variety of social, economic and environmental influences. These have the potential to impact either positively or negatively on their development.

          This topic includes:

          - relationships
          - a healthy diet
          - the environment
          - living in poverty
          - adverse childhood experiences

      2-1-3-1a:
        heading: Relationships
        body: |
          ![A young child and a practitioner playing together with brightly coloured building blocks](/assets/2-1-3-1a-636672368.jpg)

          Babies and young children need to experience positive, reassuring and dependable relationships to support their brain development. This begins with parents and carers, but as an early years practitioner you also have a significant role. Children will need to be supported to understand what appropriate relationships look like and to understand the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. This will ensure that all children are protected from pursuing the wrong relationships that could put them at risk.

          You can support their understanding through the use of appropriate activities such as:

          - shared stories
          - adult led discussion
          - robust role modelling

          Babies will begin to attempt to communicate from the very beginning. At first they communicate by crying and babbling, before moving onto more developed language skills. When others respond to these attempts at communication, these positive interactions encourage babies and young children to practise their communication skills further. As they do so, their related neurones develop further.

          When a child has built a trusting relationship with an adult, they feel less stressed and more relaxed. Relaxed children are more open to exploring and learning.

          Consistency within a relationship will further promote development. Children are more likely to become fully engaged in the environment and the experiences on offer if they have consistent:

          - responses to their behaviour
          - boundaries
          - expectations

          Children who experience positive relationships in early life are more likely to go on to build and maintain positive relationships in the future.

          Children need opportunities to explore their understanding of these relationships. Spontaneous play and role play provide excellent opportunities for children to experiment with behaviour they have observed or experienced. This gives the space to navigate their associated feelings and thoughts, and to express themselves freely without concern of judgment or expectation. Observing such play is a great opportunity to understand a child’s development.

        body: |
          ![Children and a practitioner eating together in a nursery setting](/assets/2-1-3-2a-1129632599.jpg)

          Children need a balanced diet to support the rapid brain development taking place during the early years.

          Earlier in the module we looked at how a substance called myelin coats the neurones and iron plays a key role in this process. The myelin increases the speed that electrical impulses can travel along a neurone and so improves a skill. So if a child is lacking iron in their diet, this could impact negatively their brain development.

          In the long term, a lack of iron can also lead to iron deficiency anaemia. As a result, a child may suffer from a lack of energy, making it difficult for them to concentrate or have the energy to practise new skills.

          Babies and young children need the opportunity to eat at regular intervals so they can concentrate and engage. Have you ever noticed that children can become disengaged very easily just before lunch?

          Children who are worried about when their next meal or snack is coming will not be able to learn effectively. Routines that include consistent snack and mealtimes will ensure that children do not become hungry. They can concentrate without worrying about their next meal.

          ![Two young children enjoying imaginative child led play](/assets/2-1-3-3-983462218.jpg)

          Children’s brains respond to and develop from the environment they experience. The quality of the environment will impact on the child’s acquisition of skills, knowledge and language.

          Positive influences within the early years environment will encourage the myelination of neurones.

          Characteristics of a positive environment include:

          - physical exercise activities
          - exposure to both new and unfamiliar activities
          - peer interaction
          - developing and testing language skills
          - child led activities and experiences
          - adult led activities and experiences
          - experience of managing risk and challenge
          - promotion of all areas of learning
          - adult interaction

          Negative influences such as social isolation, a lack of stimulation and limited exposure to language and communication will weaken the quality of the myelin.

          Prolonged exposure to negative influences will potentially:

          - impact upon a child’s ability to carry out basic tasks
          - result in incidents of unwanted behaviour if the child is not challenged or engaged
          - restrict language and communication development
          - result in emotional outbursts
          - lead to mental health concerns
          - result in a very short attention span
          - result in children becoming withdrawn and isolated

          ##Routines

          Children require routines to ensure that they are able to relax and feel comfortable. When children know which staff will work with them and what will happen next, they will be relaxed and ready to learn.

          4.3 million children in the UK currently live in poverty. This is around 3 in every 10 children. This means that there will likely be children within your care whose parents or carers cannot afford the basics in relation to food, shelter and clothing.

          Living in poverty can affect all aspects of a child’s development. Coming to your care hungry, being bullied because of what they are wearing or not being able to access toys and books, are all common difficulties for children living in poverty.

          Research shows that children living in low income households are 3 times more likely to experience mental health issues and have lower academic success than children from more affluent backgrounds.

          Coming from a disadvantaged area or a household in poverty should not restrict a child’s chances to succeed. Being able to identify where a child requires support and addressing individual needs is essential to ensure the child can continue to progress.

        heading: Adverse childhood experiences
        body: |
          When children are exposed to adverse childhood experiences, it will negatively impact on their overall development.

          Adverse childhood experiences are stressful and traumatic events such as:

          - abuse, including emotional abuse
          - household dysfunction, such as mental health issues or substance misuse
          - witnessing domestic abuse
          - death of a parent or sibling
          - a parent in jail

          Our bodies have systems to help us cope with short periods of stress, for example when we become scared of something. However, the stress experienced as a result of adverse childhood experiences is often prolonged and is known as toxic stress. Toxic stress can alter the way the brain develops and affect how a child’s body reacts to stressful situations.

          Children with these experiences might:

          - have difficulty sleeping
          - have difficulty concentrating
          - exhibit behavioural challenges as they struggle to process the event

          Adults who have had adverse childhood experiences are also more likely to go on to experience substance misuse, mental health difficulties and chronic illness, such as heart disease.

          As a practitioner, you can buffer children from the effects of toxic stress by offering a safe and secure relationship and positive experiences. These positive experiences can help to reset the child’s stress system and support them to develop resilience.

          Children will progress through different stages of learning. There are a number of different factors that may impact on their learning.

          ![A child playing with a shape matching toy](/assets/2-2-1-1a-1297399726.jpg)

          The term ‘cognitive development delay’ refers to the condition of children who are considered to be at a lower level than the expected milestone for their age. However this is a very subjective concept that does not take a child’s unique development journey into consideration.

          All children develop at an individual rate and experience a broad range of variations in their care and education.

          For example, as described in Development Matters (2021), at a 12 month observation checkpoint, we ask:

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>does the baby ‘take turns’ by babbling and using single words? </li>
          <li>does the baby point to things and use gestures to show things to adults and share interests? </li>
          </ul>

          If the answer to either of these questions is no, we should not necessarily assume that the child:

          - has developmental delay
          - is low ability
          - will not be able to develop this skill

          Depending on when the baby or child joined your care, you may already be aware of any individual needs or circumstances that have impacted their development.

          You may want to consider whether the child has not previously had the opportunity to:

          - experience a language rich environment
          - take turns to communicate
          - share their interests or ideas

          It is essential that you ask the relevant questions surrounding development as a child settles with you. This will ensure you can support the child’s needs fully.

          This is then the perfect opportunity to provide appropriate activities and experiences to help the baby to develop these skills.

          It’s also important to monitor if this makes an impact. If you are able to see progress, it is likely that the baby or young child simply requires more support and nurturing in that area to help secure their understanding and skills.

          If after support the baby or child continues to make no progress, then further specialist support may be needed to identify if the child is experiencing a cognitive development delay.

      2-2-1-2:
        heading: Causes of cognitive development delay
        body: |
          There are different factors that can cause cognitive development delay.

          ##Abuse

          Babies and young children require environments that are stimulating and relationships that are nurturing. When a baby or child does not receive these, they will not have the essential opportunities to develop and test their cognitive skills.

          ##Neglect

          Babies and young children require language rich environments that provide sufficient attention and interaction. Without these they will lack the stimulation needed to promote development.

          ##Genetic conditions

          The most common genetic condition that causes cognitive impairment is Down’s syndrome. Individuals with Down's syndrome have, on average, smaller brains than individuals where the syndrome is not present.

          ##Accidental cause

          Also known as acquired injury, accidental cause is where cognitive impairment results from an injury affecting the head and brain.

          ##Neurodiversity

          Neurodiverse individuals, such as those with autism, can experience delayed cognitive processing skills and communication difficulties.

          ##Pregnancy and birth related issues

          Exposure to substances such as drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can also result in cognitive difficulties for children. Birth difficulties resulting in oxygen deprivation can also cause cognitive impairment.

          Later in the module we will explore how cognitive development delay may impact on learning and development.

      2-2-1-3a:
        heading: The impact of cognitive development delay
        body: |
          When a child experiences cognitive development delay, they may have difficulty with:

          - remembering and completing everyday tasks
          - problem solving tasks
          - concentrating
          - understanding concepts
          - comprehension and understanding
          - understanding the feelings and views of others
          - planning and prioritising

          Just as each child develops differently, they will also experience the difficulties of cognitive development delay differently.

          Each day can be different too, with some days more difficult than others. This inconsistent performance can make it difficult to identify a child’s specific delays. This can be frustrating for the child, especially if their difficulties are mistakenly identified as unwanted or challenging behaviour.

          A child struggling with these difficulties will often develop low self esteem. This will impact on other areas of their development and their level of self efficacy.

          Observation checkpoints, child development knowledge, an enabling environment and high quality practitioner interactions will all be essential. This will ensure that any potential gaps in learning are not able to develop or widen.

          If a child experiences these difficulties for a prolonged period despite interventions, they may need support from a wider team of professionals.

        heading: Theories of how children learn
        body: |
          This section of the module looks at a range of theories regarding how children learn and develop their cognitive skills - the mental processes involved in learning and understanding things.

          It is important to remember that theory is just that - theoretical ideas based on the research of individuals. These theories are from a number of years ago, more recent research has both supported and criticised them. As all children are unique, you will need to consider a variety of theories and use different activities to support each child.

          This topic includes:

          Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a theory that explains the basic needs of children and the order of importance to support effective learning.

          Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is often depicted as a pyramid. He describes children’s needs in levels of importance. The most important needs form the foundation of the pyramid as the basis to build upon.

          Maslow believed the most important needs are the physiological needs, the things needed for survival. These needs include food, water, warmth and rest. Maslow concluded that all other levels depended on these needs being met first. Next came the needs of safety and security.

          It was after these needs were met that Maslow believed children could then move onto to secure belongingness and love, self esteem and self actualisation.

          Maslow believed self actualisation was where children could realise their full potential.

          Maslow concluded that without securing each stage they could not move onto the next.

          ![A child and a practitioner learning together](/assets/2-2-2-2-954812598.jpg)

          Vygotsky’s theory suggests that social interactions, cultures and the environment play a significant role in children’s development of cognitive skills.

          Vygotsky believed that children have 2 stages of development. The first stage is the skills and knowledge they can develop by themselves. The second stage is the learning that can take place with the support of a more experienced individual, referred to as a 'more knowledgeable other' (MKO).

          Vygotsky referred to this period as the zone of proximal development (ZPD). This is where children’s learning is supported by another individual who has a greater understanding than them. As the child becomes more confident and competent in this area the support is weaned away as the skill joins the first stage of learning and therefore becomes one the child can develop alone.

          In more recent years, ZPD has also become known as the zone of potential development.

        body: |
          ![A practitioner encouraging a baby to move blocks along a wire](/assets/2-2-2-3-1300381182.jpg)

          Skinner developed the behaviourist approach.

          Skinner believed that children learn as a result of what happens after a learning experience. For example, if a child has participated in an activity where they received praise, they are more likely to repeat that experience and further develop their understanding

          Skinner also believed that if a child’s behaviour or actions resulted in an unpleasant outcome or recieved a negative consequence, they would be unlikely to repeat it.

          Skinner stated that behaviour was learnt from the environment with no influence from inherited factors. Skinner thought we could therefore predict or control behaviour.

          The many criticisms of Skinner’s approach include the failure to acknowledge genetic or individual influences.

      2-2-2-4a:
        heading: |
          Theories of how children learn: Bandura
        body: |
          ![Two young children and a practitioner doing yoga. The practitioner is bent over with their hands on the floor and the children are copying her](/assets/2-2-2-4a-1219418746.jpg)

          Bandura developed the social cognitive theory. This theory suggests that children learn by observing those around them and then test what they have seen within their play and learning.

          Bandura’s experiment, known as the Bobo doll experiment, tested the concept that children would copy the behaviour they had seen. The experiment involved groups of children witnessing an adult treating a doll well or badly. In each situation the children copied the behaviour they had seen.

          Critics label Bandura’s theory and experiments as biased and unethical, suggesting that the nature and setting of the experiments were manipulating children to behave in a deliberate manner.

          More recent research suggests that a child needs to meet these 4 conditions for successful social learning to take place:

          - attention - the child needs to be able to pay attention to the behaviour being modelled with minimal distractions
          - retrieving information - the child needs to be able to remember what they have seen
          - opportunity to test observed behaviour - the child needs opportunities for spontaneous and child led play to explore the behaviour
          - motivation - the child needs to see either similarities between themselves and the role model, or an opportunity for praise or reward

          ##Self-efficacy

          Bandura also developed the concept of self-efficacy. Bandura described this as an individual's confidence in their ability to succeed.

          If a child only ever experiences success, they will not develop resilience. They will always expect to achieve and will not know how to cope with failure. Bandura believed it was the process of overcoming obstacles and persevering and then eventually achieving that supported children to positively develop both self-efficacy and resilience.

          Bandura believed that a child’s development of self-efficacy came from these 4 potential sources:

          - mastery - opportunities to master tasks or skills and experience success
          - vicarious experiences - opportunity to observe others who are similar to themselves succeeding
          - persuasion - support from influential role models in the child’s life with praise and encouragement
          - imagination  - the ability for the child to imagine themselves succeeding

An arrow points up the spiral indicating difficulty, with new content at the bottom being least difficult and mastery being the most difficult. ](/assets/2-2-2-5a-bruner-spiral.jpg)

          Bruner’s theory of cognitive development introduced the idea of the spiral curriculum. Children start to learn at a simplified level and then build upon it in increasing depth until they are able to master the task or skill.

          Bruner believed that any child of any age could understand complex information if it was presented and structured appropriately.

          Bruner proposed that children would learn when they were exposed to the same information repeatedly but in different styles and methods.

          Bruner’s methods included:

          - enactive - where children learn through hands on experiences and physical movements
          - iconic - where children build upon on the memories of the hands on experience and reinforce this imagery, so that when they think about an object or concept they can picture a relevant image
          - symbolic representation - where children will learn the correct language and symbols to explain their learning

          Bruner believed that both play and spending time with adults are vital to children’s learning. He conducted experiments that showed children’s play was less sophisticated without an adult’s input.

          Critics suggest that Bruner’s theory does not take into consideration an individual’s stage of development or opportunity for self expression.

          Theory in practice: enabling environments
        body: |
          Maslow’s hierarchy of needs reinforces the importance of an enabling environment that meets the individual needs of the children.

          It is important that children feel safe, are not hungry, and experience trusting relationships. They will then feel confident and comfortable to learn.

          ![A child doing an outdoor activity. A practitioner is helping them as a more knowledgeable other](/assets/2-2-2-7a-494562097.jpg)

          Both Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development (ZPD) and Bruner’s spiral curriculum acknowledge scaffolding. This is where children’s learning is supported and guided by a more knowledgeable other (MKO) to support understanding.

          Within scaffolding, the MKO can be a parent, carer, practitioner or peer. At first, the support given may be intensive with lots of direction. Next the child will attempt the task with less support and the MKO might use questioning or visual aids as guidance.

          The MKO continues to gradually withdraw the support techniques until the child has acquired the knowledge and skills to complete the task alone.

          Scaffolding techniques can include:

          - modelling
          - providing examples
          - working one-on-one with children
          - using visual aids
          - use of questioning
          - using prior knowledge
          - chunking knowledge to make it achievable

          Bandura’s social learning theory and concept of self efficacy can also be considered. When children are observing the MKO they are learning from their behaviours and communication. When practitioners successfully scaffold children’s learning, they are supporting children to master new skills and develop their own self efficacy.

          ![Four children playing with a dressing up box. A young boy is wearing a viking helmet, a girl is wearing some novelty glasses with coloured lenses](/assets/2-2-2-8-505476998.jpg)

          Vygotsky’s 2 stages of development match with today’s thinking regarding the importance of both child led and adult led opportunities. Vygotsky emphasises the importance of both acknowledging that each type of activity has its own role to play in development.

          Bruner explained that the sophistication of child’s play increases when an adult is involved.

          In contrast, Bandura explains the importance of children having the opportunity to learn by watching others and to imagine their own success. Adults should be conscious of this during guided activities. This is because these activities are often more focussed and potentially offer less time for observing others. Some children may feel the need to stay on task and meet expectations, and so be less likely to "wonder" or imagine, but adults should encourage them to do so where appropriate.

          Striking a balance of both child and adult led activity will be important to ensure that children can access all aspects of learning.

          In Development Matters (2021), it’s explained that:

          “Children need opportunities to develop their own play and independent exploration. This is enjoyable and motivating. They also need adults to ‘scaffold’ their learning by giving them just enough help to achieve something they could not do independently. Helping children to think, discuss and plan ahead is important, like gathering the materials they need to make a den before they start building. These are ways of helping children to develop the characteristics of effective learning."

          Children are spending excessive amounts of time watching tv, and accessing games on tablet computers and phones.  This can have a lasting effect on attention, memory and language skills, as well as impacting negatively on a child’s physical health.

          It is important that you take every opportunity to promote physical activity in the early years.

          Physical activity supports children to develop:

          - communication and language skills, as they follow instructions, label movements and work with others
          - cognitive skills, as they follow instructions, plan their movements and solve problems
          - social and emotional skills, as they work with others, experience challenge and build self awareness

          ##How much physical activity?

          Babies and young children can be physically active from birth onwards. Even before babies can crawl they can be given opportunities to reach, grasp and pull, supporting them to develop coordination later on. From around 3 months old, or when they can control their head and neck, babies should experience 30 minutes of tummy time per day. Supervised opportunities to lie on their tummies helps babies to:

          - develop stronger arm, leg and neck muscles
          - experience improved environmental awareness
          - prevent flat head syndrome

          NHS guidance is that children aged 1 to 2 years should be active for a least 3 hours per day. It is important to remember that this is not 3 hours of planned physical activity that involves running, jumping or climbing but that it also includes light activity such as standing and walking.

          The guidance recommends that older children between 3 and 5 years should also be active for 3 hours per day. At least 60 minutes of this should be moderate to vigorous activity. This guidance should inform the daily routine within the setting.

        heading: Periods of inactivity

          ![A baby crawling up a ramp on an outdoor baby gym, supported by a practitioner](/assets/2-2-3-2a-1170397465.jpg)

          It’s not ideal for children to experience long periods of inactivity. However, there are many reasons why they may do so.

          ##Technology

          Increased access to technology means that even young children are spending more time on devices such as tablets and smartphones. Access to on demand TV also means that age appropriate television programmes can be accessed for longer periods throughout the day. There are many advantages to using technology within the setting - including to support children’s language and cognitive development. However, technology should be used as part of a balanced curriculum and should have a clear set of learning intentions. You can read advice for using the internet with children in a safe way in the further activities at the end of the module.

          ##Imposed lockdowns

          The COVID-19 pandemic will have increased the amount of time children have been inactive. For those without access to outdoor space and limited indoor space, physical activity may have decreased significantly. Parents and carers who have been working from home may not have been able to incorporate physical activity into children’s daily routines. For very young children, days without physical activity may have become the norm. As a practitioner, you may need to reinforce the importance of being physically active and support children to develop and understand the associated skills.

          ##Transport

          Busier lifestyles and increasing numbers of cars on the road means that fewer children are walking and accessing public transport. This has resulted in less active lifestyles for children.

        heading: Positive partnerships with parents and carers
        body: |
          ![A parent and a practitioner with a baby in an early years setting](/assets/2-2-3-3-180713861.jpg)

          Parents and carers are the most influential individuals in a child’s life. It is essential that you work in partnership to ensure you are supporting wishes, beliefs and needs whilst also promoting healthy lifestyles. Working together with parents and carers will support consistent understanding and care for children.

          As a practitioner you can offer support to parents and carers who lack the confidence or knowledge to let children try new activities and foods. In return, parents and carers can provide a wealth of information regarding children’s interests and preferences which will encourage participation in healthy living activities and support the child to feel valued.


          You can support parents, carers and children by:

          - sharing the setting's menus with parents and carers to highlight healthy choices
          - inviting parents and carers to participate in parent and child cookery activities
          - sharing resources such as story sacks
          - encouraging parents and carers to access advice and guidance regarding healthy lifestyle initiatives such as Healthier Families (linked in further activities at the end of the module)
          - inviting parents and carers into the setting to participate in physical activities
          - sharing knowledge of local groups and clubs that promote exercise and healthy eating
          - encouraging children’s interests, such as sports teams
          - encouraging parents and carers to join the setting for activities such as "grow your own"

      2-2-3-4a:
        heading: Meal times
        body: |
          ![Two young children doing a cooking activity, supported by a practitioner](/assets/2-2-3-4a-1276510516.jpg)

          A healthy diet is important for brain development. The preparation of food and the social aspect of mealtimes can also positively support learning and development.

          Examples of encouraging children to become involved in a way that is appropriate to their level of understanding could include:

          - food preparation
          - serving themselves
          - laying the table
          - cookery activities
          - participating in activities to promote children’s understanding of healthy and unhealthy food
          - unfamiliar food tasting and sensory food education (see the further activities at the end of this module for more information)

          These activities and experiences will:

          - increase language and communication opportunities
          - promote positive social interaction
          - develop motor skills
          - encourage healthier lifestyles

          You can read advice about food safety and young children in the further activities at the end of the module.

      2-2-3-5:
        heading: Adult participation

          ![6 children and a practitioner sat in a circle. They all have their hands out, the children are copying the practitioner.](/assets/2-2-3-5-175197794.jpg)

          Leading or participating in activities and experiences that promote healthy living will benefit children in a number of ways.

          ##Increased engagement

          Adult interaction will ensure that all children are supported to participate and share their views and knowledge. Having an adult present will also set and reinforce relevant boundaries in relation to health and wellbeing.

          ##Increased vocabulary

          As you explain your actions or encourage children to communicate about their actions, you are increasing the vocabulary children hear. Providing a commentary that names your movements such as “kick your leg” or “raise your arm” will support children to be able to repeat these actions when they carry out activities independently or need to follow verbal or written instructions in the future. Understanding the language associated with physical activity will make activities feel more achievable and support children’s self-efficacy.

          ##Positive modelling

          Children are more likely to participate enthusiastically with a role model to copy or follow. Children can take confidence and reassurance from the guidance available. Children will be able to test ideas and skills they have developed independently with the opportunity for actions to be shaped and reinforced by an adult.

      2-2-3-6a:
        heading: Modelling positive relationships
        body: |
          ![Two young children sat on the floor in an early years setting. One child is showing a brightly coloured ball to the other. Behind them, two practitioners are talking and smiling.](/assets/2-2-3-6a-480576592.jpg)

          Children copy the behaviours of others around them. They especially copy those they have developed trusting relationships with, as they will regard them as reliable sources of appropriate conduct.

          The 4 main relationships a child will observe and experience whilst they are in the setting are:

          - practitioner to practitioner
          - practitioner to parent
          - peer to peer
          - practitioner to peer

          Positive and healthy relationships will effectively help a child to develop qualities and skills including:

          - respect - through positive interactions with appropriate language, manners and actions
          - trust - through being honest and honouring commitments
          - effective communication - by communicating appropriately and avoiding slang
          - empathy - to help children to see things from more than one perspective

          Children will need opportunities to test their understanding of the relationships they have experienced. Spontaneous play opportunities that allow for increased imagination and creativity will ensure children are supported to test observed behaviours.

          ![A practitioner and 5 children doing an active learning activity. Two of the children are watering some seedlings, the practitioner is encouraging and supporting them.](/assets/2-2-3-7-184997961.jpg)

          The characteristics of effective teaching and learning outlined in Development Matters (2021) are that children need opportunities to:

          - play and explore
          - experience active learning
          - create and think critically

          Research shows that you can support children’s learning by giving them the opportunity to:

          - experience enabling environments both indoors and outdoors
          - practice and develop their self-efficacy
          - take part in both adult led and child led activity
          - incorporate their interests and preferences into their learning
          - explore new and interesting knowledge, stories and songs

          It’s important to offer a balance of both adult led and child led experiences, to make sure that learning can be effectively scaffolded.

          You should also adjust the opportunities and experiences you provide for each child to the correct level of understanding. This is especially important when the child’s level of understanding does not match with the expected milestones for their age.

        heading: Recap
        body: |
          Every child will develop at their own individual rate and will experience a wide variety of influences that could potentially impact upon their brain development.

          Your role is to promote positive development and minimise negative influences and their potential impact.

          It will be common for children to experience periods where they require support to meet their expected milestones. It is important that you are able to identify where support is needed to prevent potential gaps in learning from occurring or widening further.

          It is important to continually develop your knowledge of the differing theories and concepts surrounding how children learn. This will support you to identify new and applicable strategies to support the children in your care. Not every theory or concept will apply, however this new knowledge will support you to renew and shape your approach as needed.

          Promoting and role modelling healthy lifestyles is crucial to support children and their wider families to understand the associated benefits for development.

          Without knowledge of the expected stages of development and knowledge of your individual children, it will be difficult to provide the correct environment necessary for success.
