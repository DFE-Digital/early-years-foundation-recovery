          On completion of this module you will be able to: 

            - establish and explore the stages of children’s brain development
            - explore the impact of brain development on children’s holistic development
            - examine the connection between brain development and children’s learning
            - define and evaluate the importance of effective relationships
            - explore a range of theories underpinning best practice 
            
          From birth to 5 years old, a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life. Brain development is a long process. The brain starts to develop around 2 weeks after conception and continues into adulthood.

          It’s important to understand developmental patterns and factors that can affect a child’s development. Both genetic and environmental factors impact on brain development.

          Brain development is also integral to a child’s ability to acquire and develop their language skills. As communication and language will underpin all other areas of development it is essential that we promote both brain and communication development.
