          On completion of this module, you will be able to:

          - identify and explore the stages of language development in the early years
          - review the potential factors that can affect language development
          - understand how to identify and support children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN)
          - explain the impact of language skills on learning and behaviour
          - explain the importance of a language rich approach where interactions are promoted

          The early years foundation stage (EYFS) puts language at the heart of learning and development as it underpins all seven areas of learning. The quality of the interactions and opportunities that children experience in the early years will form the foundations to promote success in later life. Children will thrive in an environment that is rich with opportunities for:

          - story telling
          - singing
          - back and forth interactions
          - imaginative and creative play

          Children’s language experiences outside of your setting will vary and it is also important to remember that children will all develop at their own individual pace. As an early years practitioner, you can help children to learn, rehearse and use a rich range of language with confidence. You can provide children with a range of opportunities to do this through:

          - the activities you offer
          - the environment you provide
          - being a good communications role model

        heading: How children develop language and communication skills
        body: |
          The first 3 years of a child’s life are the most important for language and communication development.

          All children will develop at their own individual rate. If you understand expected development, you will be able to support each child’s journey.

          The first section of this module includes:

          - stages of language development
          - theories of language development
          - factors affecting language development

      4-1-1:
        heading: Stages of language development
        body: |
          Babies and children move through typical stages while they are developing their language skills. Understanding these typical stages will help you identify speech and language problems early.

          The developmental stages outlined in this training are only intended as a guide. It is important to remember that all babies and children will develop at their own pace. Not every child will reach these stages at the age specified in this course. As a practitioner, you should consider each child's individual circumstances to offer the right support.

          ##Before birth

          In module 2, you learned that a baby’s language development begins as early as 20 weeks of pregnancy. At around 23 weeks most babies will start to hear sounds from outside the womb.

          At birth a baby might recognise familiar voices, such as those of their parents and carers, and sounds they have heard during pregnancy. Their experiences in the womb may also mean that they recognise different tones such as male and female voices.

          As a practitioner, you can use knowledge of a baby’s background to comfort and care for the baby. For example if parents and carers have sung or played a specific piece of music to the baby, you can use this to help settle them if they become distressed. Other examples could include:

          - knowing and using the names of family members, pets and places to engage the baby’s attention and encourage interactions
          - using knowledge of a child’s routine to support development – such as if a baby is more curious in outdoor environments or becomes distressed by large groups

          ##Pre-linguistic stage

          The first year of life is known as the pre-linguistic stage. In this stage babies cannot yet speak and instead use sounds.

          When a baby cries and you respond, they will feel that their attempts to communicate are working. This will encourage them to continue interacting with you.  As a baby grows, they will start to communicate in other ways. For example, as well as crying they might start:

          - pointing
          - making gestures, like rubbing their eyes
          - smiling

          Language can be either expressive or receptive. A baby's receptive language, which is their ability to understand speech, develops before their expressive language, which is their ability to speak themselves.

          They will also learn from your facial expressions and gestures. From around 2 to 4 months old a baby will react to different tones and volumes. For example, they might cry if a raised voice or noise startles them, and might gurgle or coo at a sound they find enjoyable.

          ##Babbling stage

          At around 6 to 8 months old most babies enter the babbling stage. This is where a baby will begin to make sounds such as ‘ba-ba’, ‘da-da’ and ‘ma-ma’. This is the way that babies learn, rehearse and develop future language skills.

          Babbling will become more purposeful and the baby will try to imitate simple words. They will also begin to accompany their babbling with gestures. The babbling stage continues until a baby is around 12 months old.

          $INFO

          You can support a baby’s language development at this age by:

          - acknowledging all attempts at communication, no matter how small
          - reading and talk about the images in picture books
          - talking about everyday actions, such as the nappy changing routine or the preparations taking place at mealtimes
          - singing with them and to them
          - making eye contact and use facial expressions to support your actions
          - leaving gaps after your comments or questions to encourage their understanding of how to interact with others

          ##Promoting language development with babies

          You can promote language development in every aspect of a baby’s care. You should always acknowledge a baby's attempts to communicate, and respond to them positively. This will encourage them to be enthusiastic about language and to make further attempts to communicate. You should also use the baby's name when talking to them. This will focus their attention on what you are saying, and help them to understand the content of your conversation.

          ##Nappy changing

          You can use mirrors or hanging mobiles in a nappy changing area and talk to babies about what they can see and touch. For example you may say “Who can you see in the mirror, Maryam? I can see your lovely blue eyes” or “Where are your ears? Can you touch your ears?”

          Older babies can bring a toy with them, or you can offer a selection of toys. These will need to be toys that can be easily and regularly cleaned. You can then talk about the toy. For example, you might say “Do you have a brown horse, Ishan? The horse has a lovely long tail.”

          You can also use your knowledge of the baby's family to talk about what they did on the way to the setting that day. Or, if you know that they have a family birthday, you could ask “Was it daddy’s birthday? Did daddy have a birthday cake?” You may simply discuss something  you can see, such as an item of clothing. For example, you could say “Look at your lovely tractor jumper, Sophie! Mummy said you went to the farm. Did you see a tractor?”

          You can also talk through your actions, such as “Let’s take these shoes off so that we can change your nappy. We need to lift you up so I can take your trousers off.”

          These examples will ensure that babies hear a steady stream of vocabulary, and help them make the connection between language and objects.

          ##Meal and snack times

          ![A young child being fed with a spoon](/assets/4-1-1-1b-1136214636.jpg)

          Bottle feeding is an opportunity to make eye contact and talk or sing to the baby. The conversations can follow the same types of themes as those you have while nappy changing. Even though you won't expect the baby to respond, it is still important to leave pauses. This helps babies start to understand the pattern of conversation.

          Snack and mealtimes are a great opportunity to sit down with the babies and children and create a social situation. You can talk through your actions, such as “Let’s sit with our friends so that we can have some snacks” or “Look, we have strawberries. Let’s share them out with everyone.”

          You can also talk to babies and children about the colours, shapes, and sizes of the food. You can address your comments to each of the babies, and create a conversation even when they do not respond. For example, you could say “Annie, do you like strawberries? Robert, Annie likes strawberries. Do you like them too? Annie, Robert thinks they are nice too.” You can reinforce this with positive facial expressions and appropriately placed pauses. This helps to teach the babies about conversational turn taking.

          ##Outdoor play

          Babies should have access to outdoor space where they can experience different sounds, smells and sights. You can take them on listening walks, where you talk to them about:

          - where you are going
          - what they can see
          - the sounds they can hear

          For example, you may narrate as you go along, telling them “This is the way we go to see the ducks. The birds are very noisy aren’t they, Suki?” or “Can you see the pretty yellow flowers? I think they smell very sweet."


          ##Activities

          All of the activities you plan for babies will provide an opportunity for language development. When you interact with babies you can comment on the resources being used, your actions, and the baby's actions.

          ##Treasure baskets

          You can provide babies with a wide selection of sensory items. This will promote opportunities to talk about what the items feel and look like. You can talk to babies about items being spiky, bumpy, furry, hard, or shiny. You will also be able to talk to babies about how they can use the items, such as by saying “Are you shaking the rattle, Yasmin?”

          ##Music

          You can play rhymes and songs throughout the day. This will help to ensure children hear a wide variety of vocabulary. Engaging babies in singing will further support them to understand the language used. Songs that include actions, such as 'head, shoulders, knees and toes', will increase children’s connection between the word and the body part or item.

          ##Stories

          You can share a variety of books with babies, including:

          - fiction
          - non-fiction
          - picture books
          - sensory books, such as those with textured pages or lift the flap books

          It is important to read to babies and allow opportunities for them to handle books, look at the pages and point to things they can see.

          ##Toy telephones

          ![A young child having a pretend phone conversation. The child has held the phone handset out for the practitioner to listen.](/assets/4-1-1-1b-1185932595.jpg)

          Older babies will enjoy having a pretend phone conversation. This provides lots of opportunities for them to learn about conversation turn taking. You can use your knowledge of the baby's family and interests to make lots of conversation.

          ##Messy play

          You can use materials such as pasta, jelly, water, sand and foam to create sensory activities for babies to explore. You can also add different items to the materials, such as toy animals or cars. Children can play seated in high chairs or as a larger group with a tuff tray. These activities allow for a large variety of comments and conversations. For example, you can talk about the toys, including their:

          - textures
          - smells
          - colours
          - sizes
          - materials
          - patterns

          You can also make comments about the adventures the toys might be going on. For example, you could add a toy dinosaur and talk about the noises it makes as it stomps through the jungle.

          Reflect on what you have read about effective practice for the pre-linguistic stage.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you support babies' language development in your setting?
          - Which of the above strategies do you currently use to help babies' language development?
          - How could you extend or improve on these strategies?

        heading: |
          The linguistic stage: one and two word sentences
        body: |
          ![A practitioner reading a book with three young children](/assets/4-1-1-2a-605745618.jpg)

          The linguistic stage generally begins when a child is 12 to 15 months old. In this stage, children begin to use words to express themselves.

          ##The one word stage

          During the one word sentence stage, a child will use single words with non verbal cues such as gestures. For example, they might point whilst saying "ball" to show that they want to play with the ball.

          By 15 months old, most children will be using around 10 words. They should also be able to point to the right body part when you name them.

          By the age of 18 months old, most children will have a vocabulary of between 10 and 20 words.

          To begin with, a child will recognise and attempt to use nouns such as ‘dog’, ‘ball’ or ‘cup’. Next, they will start to understand verbs such as ‘drink’, ‘eat’ and ‘walk’. Understanding of adjectives such as ‘small’, ’red’ and ‘cold’ will usually follow.

          ##The 2 word stage

          Around the age of 1 and a half to 2 years old, some children will be able to put 2 words together such as "car go" or "doll walk".

          During this period children will experience great development of their comprehension skills. This means that children will understand what you are explaining or requesting. For example, if you mention it will soon be snack time, they might go to wait at the table where this takes place.

          To encourage a child to communicate, you can:

          - ask questions or comment on their activity while they are playing independently
          - leave pauses after you speak to show you are waiting for a response – this also helps children to understand the importance of turn taking
          - make your communication meaningful by asking about the item they are holding, or something you know will interest them

          It’s important to avoid using slang or nicknames that might confuse children, for example calling toes ‘piggies’ or dogs ‘bow wows’.

          At the age of 2, most children can:

          - say 50 words
          - understand between 250 to 500 words
          - begin to follow 2 part instructions such as “get your cup and take it to the kitchen”
          - put 2 word sentences together

          ##Observing language development

          When you are observing children’s development, you can use observation checkpoints from Development Matters (2021).

          <div class='blockquote-container'>
            <blockquote class='quote'>
              <p>Around 12 months, does the baby ‘take turns’ by babbling and using single words? Does the baby point to things and use gestures to show things to adults and share interests?</p>
              <p>Around 18 months, is the toddler listening and responding to a simple instruction like: ‘Adam, put on your shoes?</p>

            </blockquote>
          </div>

          $INFO

          Talk your way through your day. This is exactly what it suggests.

          Make sure that you describe your routine actions and explain what is happening. You should use descriptive words to help children experience a wide variety of vocabulary.

          For example, if you are preparing fruit for a snack, you can include words that describe the texture such as rough, smooth, sticky, or cold.

          You can then use this language again when the child is handling and eating the fruit. You can make comments like “you have picked a banana, is it squishy? Is it cold?” Children will then be able to make the connection between the word and the feeling.

          This will help children to:

          - hear a wide variety of vocabulary
          - connect the language to the item, task or situation
          - organise and use their language in the correct way

          ##Telegraphic speech

          Telegraphic speech is the last phase of language development before a child can speak fluently. This phase usually begins when a child is around 2 years old.

          In this phase, a child can put together more meaningful sentences by combining individual words to get their point across. Their sentences will not be complete and will be missing connecting or descriptive words.

          An example of telegraphic speech is: "cat drink milk". You can repeat back what the child has said but with the correct grammar. For example, you could say "that’s right, the cat is drinking the milk".

          ##Practicing and perfecting

          From this point on, a child will be continually developing their language skills through their interactions with others. Up until the age of 3, it is common for children to communicate by repeating back the things they hear. This is a normal part of language development called echolalia. Children usually stop doing this as they develop and use a wider vocabulary.

          At the age of 3 most children can:

          - use a vocabulary of 300 words
          - understand up to 1000 words
          - understand language relating to concepts such as positioning, size and quantity
          - start to use plurals, such as ‘cats’ and ‘dogs’
          - start to use past tense, such as ‘played’ and ‘walked’
          - put a 4 to 5 word sentence together

          When you are talking to a child, you should:

          - make sure that they have at least 10 seconds processing time to consider their reply
          - try not to ask too many questions, as they may feel pressure and then not respond
          - comment on the child’s actions to ensure that they hear a wide variety of vocabulary – for example, “you are pushing your baby very carefully”

          $INFO

          You should provide lots of opportunities for children to share books.

          When sharing books, you can:

          - use both picture books and books with a range of simple and more complex text for children to follow
          - encourage the children to point to items of interest and find the items you are talking about
          - leave lots of pauses for children to share their thoughts and respond to your questions and comments

          You should also find time to share books that children bring to you, as well as encourage the sharing of books between the setting and home. This will encourage children’s interests and likes, as well as their language development.

          $INFO

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about providing opportunities for children to share books.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you consider book sharing when planning your curriculum?
          - What strategies do you currently have for sharing books with children?
          - How do you share books children have brought to you?
          - How do you share books between the setting and home?
          - How could you extend or improve on these strategies?

          ![A child having a conversation with a practitioner](/assets/4-1-1-4a-668824724.jpg)

          At around 4 years old, most children can:

          - use around 1500 words
          - tell you about the function of items, for example using a scale to measure flour for cooking
          - talk to you about past events
          - follow 3 part instructions such as "can you get a pencil, paper and scissors"
          - often use connecting words such as ‘because’, ‘and’, or ‘if’
          - use longer and more complex sentences

          You can use open ended questioning that challenges a child to give more detailed responses. For example, you could ask a child "why do you like going to the park?" The child will need to give a more descriptive answer than if you had asked them "do you like going to the park?", which would only need a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer.

          Before a child can practice and develop their vocabulary, they will need to have heard it first. It is important that you plan to introduce vocabulary, as you cannot rely on spontaneous opportunities alone. Planning the language you will introduce and reinforce will make sure that children hear a wide variety of vocabulary that is appropriate to their individual starting point and expected level of development.

          You should help children to explain how situations make them feel and to name their feelings. For example, you could ask "how did you feel when you saw your new dog?" and "why do you think he made you feel like that?"

          ##Correcting children’s language

          When a child uses the wrong pronunciation or grammar, you should:

          - make sure that the child hears the correct language
          - not tell them that they are wrong

          You can do this by modelling the correct use of language. For example, a child may say "I drawed a picture for you". Your response could be "that’s right, you have drawn a picture for me". This provides an opportunity for the child to learn by imitation.

          ##Working with others

          Another way to support language development is by encouraging children to work with others to solve problems, take part in discussions and investigate. This is called sustained shared thinking.

          While working with others, a child will have extended discussions and ask and answer questions. This will give them lots of opportunities to hear and practice new vocabulary.

          $INFO

          Try setting up an experiment style activity to encourage sustained shared thinking.

          For example, you could set up a water tray and explore which objects will float and sink.

          This will provide lots of opportunity for prediction, problem solving and discussion.

          You could ask before:

          - what do you think will happen?
          - why do you think that?

          You could ask after:

          - how could we change what happens?
          - are you surprised by that?

          - How do you currently plan opportunities for children to hear new vocabulary?
          - Could you plan more opportunities for this?

        heading: Theories of language development
        body: |
          There are many theories about how children develop language and communication skills.

          It is important to remember that theory is just that: theoretical ideas based on the research of an individual. Much the same as no one activity will suit the needs of all children, no one theory will influence how you support a child.

          It is also important to fully consider criticisms of the theory and the findings from more recent research. Not all theories will be useful or applicable to all contexts in your setting. You should consider information from multiple perspectives to make it applicable to the care you are providing.

          Your approach to supporting children with their language development should be informed by the different theories rather than just one.

          This topic includes the theories of:

          - Skinner
          - Chomsky
          - Piaget
          - Bruner

          It is important to remember that these are the views of individuals, often from many years ago. You should also consider more recent research that supports and criticises these views.

          No one theory will be completely relevant to every child’s development. Being aware of theory will support you to approach planning and care with a balanced view.

          In Module 2, we looked at Skinner’s theory of how children learn.

          His “behaviourism” theory has 3 principles:

          - imitation – where a child has the opportunity to observe and copy behaviour
          - reinforcement – where a child receives a positive or negative response to their behaviour
          - conditioning – where a child’s learning is shaped by their experiences

          He believed that these 3 principles apply to the development of all new skills, including language development.

          According to Skinner, children are born with a blank mind and develop their language skills by copying others. His theory argues that when a child copies someone, the response they receive will shape their future behaviour. This is known as reinforcement and conditioning.

          For example, if a child gets a positive response to using new language, they will be more likely to try to develop and use new language again. If the child receives a negative response, or no response at all, they might stop trying to communicate, to avoid the negative response.

          ##Criticism of Skinner's theory

          Skinner’s critics have highlighted a number of problems with the theory.

          Arguments opposing the theory include that:

          - all children follow a similar pattern of development through the 4 stages of cognitive development, regardless of the interactions or environments that they experience
          - children cannot learn the grammar rules of language development through imitation alone
          - it is too simplistic and does not take cognitive development or individual needs into consideration

          One of the biggest critics of Skinner’s work is Noam Chomsky.

      4-1-2-2:

          Theories of language development: Chomsky
        body: |
          ![Two young children doing an activity together at a table](/assets/4-1-2-2-882967098.jpg)

          Chomsky’s main belief is that language skills are essential for co-operation and survival.

          He believes that:

          - the brain is pre-wired to learn and develop language
          - everyone has a ‘language acquisition device’ – an area of the brain responsible for language development
          - the 'language acquisition device' helps children to understand the rules of language

          Chomsky compared learning language to learning other skills. For example, all children are born with an understanding of how to walk and develop this skill through practice. Chomsky believes the same theory applies to language skills. His theory suggests that all children have the instinct and ability to develop language skills, regardless of how and where they grow up.

          He argues that children do not learn language through imitation. His evidence includes that children make grammatical mistakes such as “I drawed” instead of “I drew". An adult wouldn’t say this, so a child could not have copied it. Instead, in this example, the child was testing their understanding of correct grammar.

          Chomsky also believed that, while deaf children would not learn to speak in the same way as hearing children, they would still have their language acquisition device. This would help them learn to communicate with sign language. He argued that this supported his theory that all children are born pre-wired to communicate and understand language of some form.

          ##Criticism of Chomsky's theory

          Chomsky’s critics have highlighted a number of problems with the theory. Arguments opposing the theory include that:

          - there is no way to confirm that a language acquisition device exists within the brain
          - research shows a distinct difference in children’s language skills depending on their background and experiences, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds on average 4 months behind their peers when they start school

          Theories of language development:  Piaget
        body: |
          ![An excited child playing with an abacus](/assets/4-1-2-3-1161068314.jpg)

          Piaget was the first person to carry out a systematic study of how children develop understanding. You looked at Piaget’s theory of cognitive development in module 2.

          According to Piaget’s theory, children do not think the way that adults do. He also argued that children are active learners who use experiences to learn. Piaget suggested that, as a child moves through the stages of cognitive development, they develop the logical thinking and reasoning skills needed to build their language skills.

          He explained that during the sensorimotor period (0 to 2 years old), a child’s language was for themselves. For example, during this phase, children make noises or accompany what they are doing with a few words. This is to make it a more enjoyable experience for themselves. Piaget explained that in this case, children do not need or expect a response from others around them. Piaget continued to say that, even when a child in this period receives a response, it will not affect or change their actions or further communication. He called this egocentric speech.

          During the pre-operational stage (2 to 7 years), Piaget suggested that children’s language skills improve rapidly. During this time a child is developing their mental schemas. These are mental maps which help them make sense of the world and understand the meaning of new words. Piaget explained that, from the age of 2, egocentric speech is slowly replaced by social speech.  He believed that this type of speech has more purpose as the child intends to interact with others. As a result, the child tries harder to make the communication successful by using the correct words and language structure.

          Piaget did not think that social and emotional relationships were important for language development. Instead, he believed that children need to understand a word before they can use it. This is why it is important to provide children with planned and adult led opportunities to develop and test their schemas.

          You should also make sure you have a full understanding of each child's starting point in relation to their language development. This will help you to identify any gaps in their knowledge and understanding relating to their expected level of development. You will then be able to plan to meet their needs and provide enough challenge.

          ##Criticism of Piaget’s theory

          Piaget’s critics argue that he:

          - places too much emphasis on a child progressing through the stages of development
          - overlooks the importance of the child’s learning experiences
          - underestimates a child’s abilities
          - does not recognise that a child could master a skill or learn a concept that belongs to an older age expectation

          This may lead to us not challenging children enough, as we may have low expectations of their ability. This is why it is important to be aware of each child’s individual abilities and plan effectively to provide appropriate challenge.

          Theories of language development: Bruner

          ![A practitioner with a group of children. The practitioner is high-fiving one of the children.](/assets/4-1-2-4a-1369912893.jpg)

          You looked at Bruner’s theory of how children learn in module 2. He believed that both play and spending time with adults are vital to children’s learning.

          Bruner agreed with Chomsky that all children are born with a natural drive to learn language. However, he also argued that this drive alone was not enough. He thought that children also need lots of interaction with others to fully develop their language skills.

          Bruner called his research the social interactionist theory, and believed that:

          - children’s desire to communicate with others pushes them to learn the necessary language skills
          - the quality of the social interactions that children experience will shape the quality of their language skills
          - the environments a child experiences will impact on their language development

          He explained that children need those around them to correct their language mistakes and scaffold their learning. He named these essential interactions as a language acquisition support system.

          ##Criticism of Bruner’s theory

          Bruner’s theory can question the criticisms of all of the other theories you have looked at.

          For example, you have learnt that Piaget’s critics argue that he places too much emphasis on a child progressing through the stages of development, while overlooking the importance of the child’s learning experiences. However, Bruner acknowledges both the importance of learning opportunities and social interaction.

          Chomsky’s critics argued that his theory did not take social background and experience into consideration. They also thought he focused too much on cognitive ability. However, Bruner acknowledges the relevance of both factors.

          Skinner’s critics argued that children cannot learn the grammar rules of language development through imitation alone. They also said that his theory does not take cognitive development or individual needs into consideration. Bruner’s theory takes all of these points into consideration.

          $INFO

          We have discussed the theories of Skinner, Bruner, Piaget and Chomsky. They show how important it is to consider children's language development from more than one perspective.

          When curriculum planning, make sure you include the key components needed for effective language development.

          These could be:

          - adult led activity for children to imitate
          - child led activity for children to rehearse language they have heard
          - opportunities for adults to support language development during child initiated play
          - age and stage appropriate activities that help children to develop their language
          - opportunities for children to hear language in conversations, music, and stories
          - opportunities for children to interact with others

        heading: Factors affecting language development
        body: |
          There are many different factors that can affect a child's language development. The impact of these factors can be positive or negative.

          You should not see these factors as barriers to a child's development or indicators of a lack of intelligence. They are an opportunity to identify the support the child needs.

          You also should not assume that a child who has had positive experiences does not need your support.

          This topic includes:

          - socio-economic factors
          - supporting children affected by socio-economic factors
          - English as an additional language
          - supporting children with English as an additional language

      4-1-3-1:
        heading: Socio-economic factors
        body: |

          Each child will have a different experience of care outside of your setting.

          Children's experiences at home impact on their early language development and future attainment.

          The importance of these experiences is detailed in the Government's paper 'Improving the home learning environment - A behaviour change approach' (linked in the further reading at the end of this module).

          ##Household income

          The financial situation in a household can affect the experiences and resources that children have access to. The impact this has on children's development could be either positive or negative. It is important that you support all children. This can help reduce the chance of any gaps in development happening or widening.

          For example, when parents have more disposable income, their child might have access to more books and resources. They may also have more experiences such as holidays and days out. This could result in the child hearing a wider range of vocabulary. However, it does not necessarily mean they will have high quality interactions.

          Children from lower income households may interact more with their parents or carers. This is because the parent or carer may be more creative with the activities they provide. For example, they may spend more time with their child, as they may not have technology like tablets, phones and TV packages to occupy their child’s time.

          Household income can also affect the relationships that children have with their parents or carers. For example, parents or carers who worry about money may show more stress, leading to negative interactions with their child. This could be the same for children whose parents have demanding and stressful jobs. These parents and carers may have limited interactions with their children as a result of trying to manage both work and childcare.

          </div>

          ##Parents' or carers' education

          If a parent or carer has negative or limited experiences of learning opportunities, they may not realise their importance. For example, if a parent or carer does not appreciate the value of books and reading, they may not provide books for their child.

          Social expectations of communication include changing your tone or volume to suit the situation, and taking turns to talk. If a parent or carer has not experienced these social expectations, they will not pass them on to their child. You will look at the social expectations in full detail later in the module.

          ##Housing

          Where a child lives and their living conditions will affect their language development. Location can determine access to activities, as well as the people a child socialises and communicates with.

          For example, a child who lives in a rural area with limited access to transport may spend all their time with their parents or carers. In comparison, a child who lives in a town or city may be able to socialise with others more often.

          Housing conditions may impact on a child’s:

          - quality of sleep
          - diet
          - hygiene
          - mental health and wellbeing

          These factors can affect their self confidence, concentration and learning.

          ![A child and practitioner playing with wooden blocks in a nursery setting](/assets/4-1-3-2a-962169936.jpg)

          It is important to understand each child's individual starting points. You will then be able to use this information alongside your knowledge of expected levels of development to plan accordingly.

          For example, perhaps you know that a child has difficulties with pronunciation. Using this information you can plan to include activities that help the child practise naming or identifying items. This could include story time, games using picture flashcards or outdoor bug hunts. You can start with objects with shorter names, then progress towards more difficult and longer names.

          You should not assume that a child is having difficulty communicating because they are experiencing language development issues.

          There may be other factors that have affected the child's language development. For example, at home they may not have been:

          - expected to make eye contact
          - read stories by their parents or carers
          - able to handle books themselves
          - encouraged to sing

          Children need repeated opportunities to hear, learn and rehearse language. If a child doesn’t get these opportunities at home, it will affect their language development.

          There might be several reasons that a child does not want to take part in discussions or bring items in from home. Some children will not be able to talk about their favourite holiday because they have not been on holiday. Others may feel that their items, such as a favourite toy, will be considered silly in comparison with the technology that others have. This might lead to a child thinking they have nothing to contribute, or make them shy away from activities so that they do not have to share.

          You should approach activities and discussions with sensitivity and make sure to include all children. Knowing your children and their backgrounds well will help you to plan inclusive activities and discussions.

          Later in the module, you will consider how to ensure that children have access to positive role models and a wide range of activities and resources. You will also explore how you can support parents, to ensure that they promote development in a language rich home environment.

          This will help all children to progress, regardless of their previous experiences.

          Reflect on what you have read about supporting children whose language development is affected by socio-economic factors.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you use your knowledge of children's socio-economic background to support your planning?
          - What strategies do you use to make sure all children are included and develop positive self-image?
          - How could you extend or improve on these strategies?

          It is likely that you are caring for, or will care for, a child with English as an additional language (EAL).

          Children may have English as an additional language for a variety of reasons. This may be because they:

          - have moved to the UK from a non English speaking country
          - were born in the UK, but only experienced their first language at home
          - were born in the UK to parents who speak more than one language

          Some children may appear to speak English well. However, you should not assume that other aspects of their understanding of English are as well developed.

          ##Working with parents

          When a child enters your care speaking little or no English, it can be scary and frustrating for them. You will need to work with parents to support the child’s development.

          This may be difficult if English is an additional language for them also. You may need to translate key documents, or work with a translator, to make sure you can collect all the necessary information.

          You may also have other parents within the setting who speak more than one language. They might be able to offer support, such as translating information for parents new to the setting.

          ##Communicating with the child

          You should begin by introducing and repeating key words. This will help the child to learn and build their confidence. You can introduce new vocabulary with visual aids such as gestures, images and labels.

          Some children may need a more formal visual support system, such as a picture exchange communication system (PECS). PECS provide children with pictures to help them express themselves and understand the routine. This can reduce anxiety for children and minimise frustration when they are not able to communicate their needs.

          Helping children to understand English will make sure that they can feel safe and secure at the setting. If a child is worried and anxious, they will not be able to relax and learn.

          ##Acknowledging a child’s first language

          It’s important to acknowledge a child’s first language to support their confidence and a positive self image. You can do this by celebrating a child’s culture and including resources that will be familiar to them.

          For example you could:

          - offer books in dual languages so you can talk about the images - this helps the children develop their recognition of a wide variety of letters and words
          - include relevant items for role play – this also helps other children’s cultural understanding
          - ensure children’s names are spelt and pronounced correctly to support positive self image
          - include positive images that the child can relate to within displays and resources
          - encourage children to share songs and rhymes in their native language

          This all helps to create a diverse environment for children in your care. Later in the module you will look at further strategies to help you do this.

        heading: The impact of language skills on learning and behaviour
        body: |
          A child’s language skills will affect their ability to communicate their needs, manage their feelings and understand others. If a child’s communication needs are not met, or they are not sufficiently challenged, their communication attempts may be displayed as frustration or behaviour that you find challenging.

          By fully understanding a child's starting point, you can notice any gaps in their knowledge and skills. You can use this information, and your knowledge of expected levels of development, to inform your planning. This will ensure you offer activities and experiences that help to reduce these gaps.

          All children will develop at their own individual rate. It is important that you are aware of the contributing factors that affect their communication skills.

          The next section of this module includes:

          -  Identifying speech, language and communication needs

          You play a central role in identifying and supporting children’s speech, language and communication needs. By combining your knowledge of each child with your professional judgement, you can make sure they receive the support they need. This will prevent any potential gaps in development from happening or becoming worse. It will also ensure that every child receives high quality care.

          If a child has not reached the expected milestones for their age, they may be referred to as having speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). Sometimes this will be as a result of language development delay. However, all children will develop at their own pace and minor delays are not a cause for concern. They can often be resolved through early intervention.

          ##Recognising needs through observation

          You will be observing children throughout their daily interactions and activities. You may be concerned if you notice that they:

          - are difficult to understand or have difficulty understanding you
          - withdraw from or avoid interactions with others
          - appear shy or quiet
          - become frustrated easily
          - make limited eye contact
          - have difficulty with communication rules such as turn taking during conversations
          - use a limited vocabulary in comparison to their expected milestone
          - have repeated difficulties over a prolonged period, such as those with mispronunciation

          A child may not have difficulty with all aspects of communication. For example, they may struggle with talking, while being good at understanding others. Another child may have no difficulty with talking, but may find it difficult to use language appropriately. For example, children may have difficulty with conversation skills. This could include taking turns or understanding how their conversations will make others feel. They may also find it difficult to support their conversation with non verbal cues like eye contact or facial expressions.

          - How do you share observations with parents and carers?

          ![A practitioner supporting a child with a shopping activity](/assets/4-2-1-2-1170395430.jpg)

          Early intervention is when you identify a difficulty as soon as possible and use appropriate action to support a child’s development.

          This may be support that you can offer in the setting. For example, a child may simply not have much experience of interacting with others. Providing opportunities to interact with others will support the child’s development. Other examples could include:

          - one to one or small group activities for children who lack confidence in larger groups
          - increasing participation in adult led activity
          - adding visual cues and items children can handle to promote understanding of words – a story sack is an example of adding items for the children to handle
          - incorporating children’s interests by using a familiar item or topic – this builds a child’s confidence and promotes interest and engagement


          If children continue to struggle, particularly after you have intervened, they may have additional communication needs. Examples could include:

          - hearing impairments, from partial to full hearing loss
          - speech impairments, such as stuttering, stammering and selective mutism

          In this case, you may need to seek additional support. This would still be considered to be early intervention support if it is received in the pre-school age range.

          Your knowledge of the child will be crucial to ensure they get the correct support. It is important to remember that not all children with lower than expected language skills will need special educational support. Children might have experienced limited interactions, for example during lockdown, or may just need more time to develop their skills.

          You may need help from other professionals if a child:

          - hasn’t made progress after early interventions
          - has a diagnosed SLCN
          - shows signs of additional communication needs

          ##Special educational needs coordinator

          If you have concerns, you should work with your special educational needs coordinator (SENCO).

          Nurseries and childminders must have arrangements in place to support children with SEN or disabilities.

          If you work in a maintained nursery school or school based nursery which is funded by the local authority you will have your own Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO). Other types of nurseries are expected to identify a SENCO.

          Childminders are encouraged to identify a person to act as a SENCO and childminders who are registered with a childminder agency or who are part of a network may share the role between them.

          The SENCO will:

          - coordinate the support the child needs
          - manage communication between all the professionals and the child’s parents or carers

          You will be responsible for gathering the supporting evidence needed.

          ##Speech and language therapist

          You may also work with a speech and language therapist (SALT).

          The SALT will:

          - complete an assessment of the child’s stage of language development
          - put appropriate support strategies in place
          - share support strategies with you and the child’s parents or carers, to make sure that the child receives consistent care

          You will learn more about children’s additional needs in a later module about special educational needs and disability.

          You may also care for children who are working beyond their expected levels of development. You will need to make sure these children have appropriate challenge. This will help them stay motivated and enthusiastic about learning and using new language.

          You can do this by:

          - providing books and resources intended for the next stage of development
          - challenging the child to answer questions or participate in discussions with fuller responses
          - encouraging the child to create and share their own stories

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about supporting children with their communication and language skills.

          Think of a child in your care.

          Consider the following questions:

          - Do you think this child is working to their expected level of development?
          - What makes you think this?
          - What strategies have you put in place to help them develop and progress?
          - How could you change or improve  your curriculum to support this child further?

          It is important that you know each child well enough to meet their individual needs.

          Observations of children are vital in helping you to support their language needs and promote development. You should take time to notice what children can do and what they know. You can use the observation checkpoints within Development Matters (2021) to support you. They will help you to make a professional judgement about whether a child's current skills meet the expected level of language development for their age.


          You should note children’s development in different situations and environments, as this may affect their use of language. For example are they more chatty outside, with a specific member of staff, or during a particular activity? You can use this information to plan to meet the child’s needs.

          Information from parents and carers will also help you to identify children’s language needs. However, it is important to address the subject with sensitivity to avoid causing unnecessary worry.

          Parents will be able to:

          - compare the child's use of language at home to how they use language in the setting
          - share strategies they have used or are using to promote language development
          - identify potential causes, such as a change in circumstances at home, if there is a concern about the child's development


          You will also be able to share the strategies you are using in the setting. This will ensure children receive consistent care.

          Observations and recording findings should not be time consuming or take you away from interacting with the children. You should use the findings to inform your planning of the child’s next steps. You can then put support in place.

          This should include:

          - intervention during adult led activities
          - child led opportunities to experiment and explore

          You will then be able to assess the impact of your support and further observations will support you to plan new next steps.

          You will look at observation, assessment and planning in more detail in a future module.

          Speech and language skills are vital for children’s personal, social and emotional development. A child's ability to communicate will affect their self-confidence, self-efficacy and self-esteem. It can also impact on their ability to:

          - join in discussions
          - build positive relationships
          - understand instructions
          - communicate their needs

          This topic includes:

          - The impact on self-regulation

          </div>

          Self-regulation is the ability to manage your behaviour and your reactions. You learnt about self-regulation in module 3. A child’s level of communication will affect their ability to self-regulate.

          If a child lacks the communication skills to express their needs, they may become frustrated. This can then lead to behaviour that you may find challenging.

          You can use a variety of strategies to help children manage their frustration and promote self-regulation.

          ##Managing challenging behaviour

          If the child’s behaviour is not causing any harm to anyone, you should try to avoid giving it your attention. If the child thinks challenging behaviour is a good way to get your attention, they will continue. Remember to give lots of praise when the child is behaving in a positive manner.

          ###Distraction
          You can distract children from the challenging behaviour without drawing attention to it. This can involve:

          - encouraging the child into a different area or activity
          - using a child’s interest or favourite areas
          - focussing the child’s interest on an adult led activity

          ###Keep things predictable

          Keeping the daily routine and your behaviour predictable helps children to feel safe, secure and confident. If a child feels confident and settled, it will minimise their reactions to frustrations. If they do become frustrated, they will know your expectations and the response they will receive.

          ###Alternative communication methods

          You can give children alternative methods to help them to communicate their needs. Alternative communication methods could include PECS or Makaton. Makaton is a language programme that uses symbols and signs alongside speech to help people to communicate. You can find out more about Makaton in the further reading at the end of this module.

          ###Lack of challenge

          Children who lack stimulation can also have difficulty regulating their behaviour. When planning your curriculum, it is important to use your knowledge of children's starting points and expected levels of development. This will ensure that it meets each child's individual needs and promotes progress.

          You should:

          - tailor activities and experiences to meet gaps in children's knowledge, understanding and experience
          - have lots of activities and resources available for the next stage of development
          - be prepared to extend a child’s thinking with appropriately challenging questions and comments

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about the impact of language development on self-regulation.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you make sure that the children in your care are challenged according to their individual starting points?
          - When planning your curriculum, how do you tailor your activities, discussions and resources to meet the needs of children of different ability levels?
          - How do you support parents to continue to challenge their children at home?
          - What impact does this have on the children's behaviour and learning?
          - Is there anything you could change or improve?

          ##Lack of confidence

          If a child has limited communication skills, they might lack confidence. Without support, a child might choose to avoid interactions and become withdrawn and isolated. A child who has experienced negative communication within their friendship group, such as teasing, may be more reluctant to interact with others.

          ##Lack of experience

          You might care for children who have good communication skills, but have not yet learned to use these skills:

          - in social situations
          - to build positive relationships

          ##Increased adult interaction

          A child who has experienced lots of positive adult interaction may have very advanced communication skills. They may become frustrated if their peers do not have the same skills or confidence.

          It’s important to carry out adult led activities that ensure these children can take part in challenging tasks and discussions. This will help to make them enthusiastic about language and communication. For example, you can add challenge to an activity by increasing the number of open ended questions that you use.

          Open ended questions are those that cannot be answered with 'yes' or 'no'. They are beneficial because:

          - the person asking the question can give the conversation their full attention - this will help children feel valued and important
          - they encourage children to explore their thoughts and feelings to give a more detailed response
          - they help to promote teamwork and problem solving, leading to sustained shared thinking

          You should use your knowledge of each child's starting point to tailor your questions. Make sure the questions focus on areas where children need to develop their language skills and explore their thoughts. This will help them take their next steps in learning towards appropriately challenging end points.


          ##Providing support

          In each of these situations, it is important that you act as a good role model for communication.

          You should demonstrate:

          - appropriate volume and tone for different situations
          - turn taking in communication
          - acceptable language
          - listening to others

          You should model your expectations in a variety of group sizes, both indoors and outdoors. This will make sure that children understand what positive social communication looks like in different situations.

          $INFO

          You could try using a communication buddying system for children around 3 years of age or older.

          This is where you group children with varying levels of communication skills together during adult led or large group activities.

          Children who lack confidence will benefit from working with more confident children. Children who are above their expected level will develop their positive self image by helping others.

          Make sure you move the groups around so that children experience a variety of communication styles and levels.

          Remember to also consider children whose communication skills are above the expected level. They will need additional opportunities to develop their own skills.

          Every child’s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have been different. As a result, it could have had both positive and negative impacts on their language development. You should consider each child’s individual experiences and identify the support they need.

          This topic includes:

          - The potential positive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
          - The potential negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic

          ![A young child watering some plants in the garden using a watering can](/assets/4-2-3-1a-697766624.jpg)

          ##Increased family interactions

          Children who live with extended family may have had increased interaction with others. As a result, they may have experienced a wide range of vocabulary and learning experiences.

          If children spent more time than usual with their family and developed positive relationships, they may now have a more positive self-image. They may also have become more confident communicators.

          ##New skills and interests

          Parents and carers may have been able to spend more time with children learning a new skill or sharing an interest. These children may have learnt new vocabulary. For example, children may have helped with a building or gardening project at home. As a result, they now may be able to identify and discuss relevant tools and what they are used for.

          ##Older siblings

          Children may have experienced a more advanced vocabulary by, for example, talking and listening to older siblings. They may also have had access to resources designed for older children. This means that these children will have experienced and rehearsed challenging vocabulary.

          ##Reading

          Children may have spent longer periods of time being read to or exploring books. As a result, they may have experienced a wider range of vocabulary.

          ##Learning new songs

          Children may have had the opportunity to learn a new musical instrument or new songs. This means they will have heard a wide range of vocabulary. They will also have had the opportunity to learn about different types of communication, such as rhyming words. If music has become a regular part of their routine, then the same music and songs will have been repeated. This will have given children lots of opportunity to practice and perfect their understanding and use of these words.

          ##Limited outings and experiences

          Lockdowns limited the number of outings and experiences children were able to have. As a result, children may have missed out on learning new vocabulary. For example, on a trip to the farm, a child might learn new language by discussing animal names, habitats and care.

          ##Confidence with new people and situations

          Children may now lack confidence when meeting new people or in unfamiliar situations.

          Some children may not have had the chance to speak to people outside their household. As a result, they may lack the confidence or enthusiasm to meet new people or engage in social situations.

          When meeting new people, they may experience unfamiliar vocabulary or social expectations like the need to:

          - adapt their volume to the environment
          - make eye contact when speaking to others

          This may cause them to cling to their parents and carers, or be reluctant to visit new places and people.

          ##Picking up bad habits

          If children have spent more time with siblings and parents who have poor language skills, they may have picked up bad habits. This could include the use of inappropriate language or slang. Children may not understand the importance of adapting their volume to the environment or the need for eye contact when talking to others.

          ##Increased use of technology

          Children may have had increased access to technology including computers, TVs and mobile phones. While this means that children may have been exposed to new vocabulary, it is not as effective as the interactions that take place between people. Children will not have received responses or had the opportunity to question misunderstanding.

          ##Masks and facial expressions

          Because people have been wearing masks, children have had less practice in reading facial expressions. This may have affected how they build relationships and communicate. It may also make them confused when they try to read facial expressions.

          ##Missing out on support

          Children have missed the routine observations that take place in a childcare setting. This may mean any speech and language needs may not be identified. This has led to reduced opportunities for early intervention.

          Children may also have missed out on specialist support which they were previously receiving. For example, children who get help from a SALT will not have received this support during the pandemic.

        body: |
          Research shows a strong link between the number of words a child hears in the first 3 years of their life, and the quality of their language development. In your role, you can make sure children have lots of opportunities to hear as many new words as possible.

          This topic includes:

          - The importance of the practitioner’s role in a language rich environment
          - Strategies to help children develop language and communication skills

          ![A practitioner working with some children in a nursery setting](/assets/4-3-1-1a-1-1346506872.jpg)

          Your role is central to a successful language rich approach. You should make opportunities for children to:

          - hear new vocabulary
          - use language during interactions with others
          - learn how to use appropriate communication

          It is important that you plan opportunities to introduce children to a wide range of new words. You cannot rely on  spontaneous opportunities alone.

          When planning activities, you should make note of what vocabulary children will be hearing and practicing. You should also tailor your planning to make sure you consider children's individual starting points.

          This will ensure that you offer a wide variety of activities and opportunities to support children's progress.

          ##Social expectations

          Children need opportunities to learn, rehearse and develop their understanding of communication skills within social expectations.

          These skills include being able to:

          - adjust their volume to suit the situation, such as quieter voices for indoor spaces
          - take turns when talking, to show that they can listen and interpret information
          - listen to what is being said, to show interest and empathy
          - make eye contact, to support effective listening
          - use their tone of voice to aid verbal communication and self-expression
          - understand proximity – being at an appropriate distance from people when communicating

          As a positive role model, you can also reinforce what you say with gestures and facial expressions. This will help children to make connections between an object, person or place and its name. Your facial expressions will help children to understand social situations and emotions. It will also encourage them to build positive relationships with you.


          ##Building positive relationships

          ![A practitioner sitting at a table with a group of five children. The practitioner is reading a book about the alphabet to the children as they listen attentively.](/assets/4-3-1-1a-2-877290928.jpg)

          When a child feels valued, they will believe their thoughts are important. This makes them more likely to communicate. When you create a positive relationship with a child, you give them confidence and motivation to learn. If a child knows they will get a kind and considered response, they will be more confident when communicating their needs and thoughts.

          As well as embracing spontaneous interactions, it is also important to plan time for relationship building and talking. This can be as a large group, in a small group or one to one.

          Examples can include:

          - the period at the start of the day where you gather the group together to welcome everyone for the day
          - meal and snack times
          - providing a quiet place to chat – this could be a cosy area with cushions or bean bags where children can gather in groups
          - storytime and sharing books

          ##Build children’s confidence

          It is important that you are truly present in your interactions with children.

          You should:

          - come down to the child’s level and make eye contact where possible
          - listen to what they are saying without interrupting
          - ensure that they do not feel rushed when talking
          - respond to show you have heard them
          - offer the child praise for sharing their thoughts

          This lets the child know their views are important.

          You should also plan opportunities that encourage children to:

          - take part in group discussions and activities
          - listen to and value what their peers are saying
          - reflect on their interactions to support them to develop future interactions


          No matter how insignificant a comment might seem, it is important to the child making it. As such, it is very important that you listen.

          ##High expectations for every child

          No child should be considered as low ability. You should tailor your practice and the opportunities you give a child to meet their needs. This applies to all children, including those who are below the expected level and those who need further challenge.

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about the importance of the practitioner's role in children's language development.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you make sure that children learn about social expectations for communication?
          - What opportunities do you plan into the day for relationship building and talking?
          - In group discussions, how do you make sure each child is heard?
          - How do you make sure that children feel their interactions are valued?
          - Could you extend or improve your curriculum to further support this?

          ![A practitioner and three children doing an activity with a sand pit](/assets/4-3-1-2a-544357094.jpg)

          There are a variety of ways that you can model the correct use of language for children and develop their vocabulary.

          ##Using commentary
          Commentary is where you add a verbal explanation to the things you see, hear and do. There are different kinds of commentary.

          ###Parallel talk
          You can provide a commentary of what you or the child is doing. For example you may say to a child "you are playing with the pink teddy" or "you are pushing the car - is the car going fast?"

          This is known as parallel talk, because your commentary runs in parallel with the child’s actions. This helps them to associate the language with the action.

          ###Self-talk
          You can can also add commentary to your own actions. For example, you could say "I am putting the books away in the bookcase, can you see all the books?" or "I am washing my hands so they are clean. The soap is pink."

          This is also known as self-talk. While it can sometimes feel unnatural, it is extremely beneficial to children. When you add this commentary, a child is hearing a constant stream of new vocabulary. It also helps them to understand instructions. For example, they will understand that ‘washing your hands’ means using soap and water to clean them. So, when you ask them to wash their hands, they will understand the action required.

          Sharing commentary will support children to name everyday items and understand routine tasks.

          Routine tasks such as nappy changing and mealtimes are also ideal opportunities to engage children in commentary and conversation. For younger children this will be an opportunity to identify objects, foods and colours. These are also good times to ask questions, such as whether the children are enjoying their food or what they can see around the changing mat.

          Even when you are not expecting a response, this is a chance to show children the importance of turn taking in conversation. You should acknowledge any attempt to respond positively, to reinforce further attempts. Older children may take these opportunities to discuss related topics, or to have a general discussion they are keen to share.

          ##Expansion

          Another strategy for modelling language is expansion, where you expand on what the child is saying. For example if a child says "bear", you could respond by saying "Yes, it’s a bear and it’s wearing a lovely blue shirt". This will help the child to learn a wider range of vocabulary.

          ##Reasoning

          Reasoning is where you help children to make sense of the things around them. You provide activities that encourage investigation and exploration, and encourage children to talk about why they think something is behaving in a certain way. For example, why ice melts or why a car needs round wheels to move. You can also help children to understand why their actions can result in certain feelings, such as why not sharing can make their friends feel sad.

          ##Positive feedback

          It is important to offer positive feedback when children communicate. This can be verbal feedback accompanied by facial expressions and gestures. For example, a smile or thumbs up. Children will seek this positive feedback, which will encourage them to practise and build their language skills.

          ##Singing and reading

          ![Children singing and doing hand actions.](/assets/4-3-1-2a-1184733843.jpg)

          You should use both planned and unplanned opportunities to share books and sing songs and rhymes with children whenever you can. When children hear repeated songs, such as familiar nursery rhymes or your daily welcome song, they have the opportunity to perfect their language.

          When you introduce new songs, children will experience new vocabulary. You can use songs that have actions to reinforce the language they are singing. For example, you could encourage children to touch their head, shoulders, knees and toes whilst singing. This will provide a visual cue that reinforces their understanding.

          ##Use of children’s interests

          You can incorporate a child’s interests into all areas of the environment. For example, if a child likes dinosaurs, you can offer dinosaur books, role play, clothes and sand pit toys.

          You can also use their interest in dinosaurs to develop communication and mathematics skills. One way to do this is by using toy dinosaurs to discuss colour, size and number. You could also encourage children to describe the dinosaur, where they live and what they eat.

          This has many benefits including:

          - increased confidence, as children feel more knowledgeable and valued
          - motivation to learn more

          ##Promoting choice

          Encouraging a child to make choices will promote confidence and independence. As well as this, it will often also create a situation where discussion can take place. In turn, this can lead to opportunities to expand children’s ideas, such as by talking about the reasons for their choices.

          For example you could ask a child to choose:

          - what they would like to eat or drink
          - which songs to sing
          - which book to read
          - creative materials, for example which colour of paint to use

          The physical environment of your setting should support you in your role. This includes the routine, resources and activities in your setting. All 3 of these should include lots of opportunities for children to hear, learn and rehearse new vocabulary.

          When planning your environment, you should consider the characteristics of effective learning.

          According to Development Matters (2021), these characteristics are:

          - playing and exploring, where children can investigate and ‘have a go’
          - active learning, where children concentrate and persevere through difficulties
          - creating and thinking critically, where children develop their own ideas and develop strategies

          This topic includes:

          - The physical environment
          - A balanced approach
          - A diverse environment
          - The outdoor environment

        body: |
          ![A nursery room](/assets/4-3-2-1a-1067731518.jpg)

          When you plan your environment, you should consider how each area or activity will promote:

          - interactions with others
          - discussion
          - curiosity, leading to investigation

          ##Books

          As well as reading to children, you should also provide lots of opportunities for children to look at books themselves.

          You should encourage children to:

          - use the book corner during routine parts of the day, such as at welcome time in the morning
          - visit the book corner on their own
          - understand correct handling and care of books

          As noted in the EYFS framework, skilled word reading including decoding is taught in the later stages of the EYFS. It is important to note that formal phonics teaching should not usually begin until reception year.

          ##Imaginative play

          Role play encourages children to learn, rehearse and develop new vocabulary. Children become absorbed in their own play and enjoy testing their language skills.

          ##Creative play

          Activities like drawing, painting and cooking have lots of opportunities for conversation. You can talk to children about the materials they are using and the project they are completing. You can also help children to discuss colours, textures and patterns using commentary and modelling.

          Creative and imaginative activities often lead to more spontaneous conversations. These activities can also help children to discuss personal topics, like their families or interests.

          For example, children may paint pictures of their families or create models of their favourite things. You can then encourage them to talk about what they have made. This will often lead to a conversation about children's experiences outside of the setting. It can also encourage them to share their views and opinions about their interests. When you carry out these activities with individual children, you give them the chance to talk about their feelings on a one to one basis.

          ##Displays

          You can use wall and table displays to promote discussion.

          When making displays you should:

          - include items children can handle
          - include items of personal interest, such as photos
          - involve children in the planning and creation

          ##Setting layout

          Different layouts can encourage different types of interactions.

          You should make sure that you have:

          - a space large enough for everyone to gather to take part in storytelling or discussions
          - areas that encourage children to gather in small groups
          - quiet areas where children can process their learning or look at books

          $INFO

          You can use the points identified on this page to evaluate your setting.

          Consider how each area or activity:

          - promotes interactions and discussion
          - encourages curiosity and creativity

          Over one week, watch how the children use the setting.

          This will help you identify whether certain times of the day or types of activities promote more interaction.

          You can then use this information to make any changes to your curriculum and environment.

          ![Two children sat on the floor exploring an activity board together](/assets/4-3-2-2a-1334556380.jpg)

          It is important that children experience a balance of both adult and child led opportunities to develop language skills. Children need to experience adult led activities so they can observe and copy positive behaviour. They then need to experience child led activities to test their new language skills.

          ##Adult led activities

          Adult led activities give children opportunities to interact in a more formal manner.

          This helps children to understand how to:

          - follow the rules of social interaction, such as turn taking
          - listen to the views of others
          - use appropriate tone and volume

          You can make sure that every child participates. You can also use the strategies from earlier in the module – including modelling, reasoning and positive feedback.

          Adult led activities also allow children to take part in sustained shared thinking. You can help children to extend their discussion and critical thinking by making comments about their actions or asking questions where appropriate.

          For example, if they are hunting for bugs you can provide commentary, such as “this black bug is much bigger than the other one”. This will often lead to children discussing sizes or extending their hunt to see if they can find even bigger bugs.

          Some children may lack confidence in adult led activities and:

          - worry that their answers are wrong
          - worry that they will not meet your expectations
          - be happy for other children to be more dominant in group activities

          That is why it is important to make sure that all children take part, and to plan for a mixture of one to one, small group and large group activities.

          ##Child led activities

          When a child has initiated an activity, they often feel more freedom to test new learning and skills without fear of being wrong. This can result in deeper thinking, increased imagination and curiosity. When the activity involves interacting with others, children will hear and develop a wide range of vocabulary.

          Some children will feel more confident in smaller groups, or groups they have created themselves. This will build their confidence and lead to increased conversation.

          When children are more curious or interested in a topic, they will ask more questions. However, if an adult is not involved, the child may not receive the correct answers. You can use the child’s particular interest to plan adult led or one to one activities. The child can then ask their questions and you can extend the discussion further.

        body: |
          Children learn best when they can relate to the resources they are using.

          You should make sure to use resources that reflect a variety of:

          - genders
          - characteristics
          - cultures
          - disabilities
          - family groupings

          Doing this will make sure that children:

          - feel valued and important – improving their self-image, confidence and self-efficacy
          - are able to understand and celebrate our differences
          - can build positive relationships with their peers

          Earlier in the module, you looked at strategies to celebrate the culture of a child with English as an additional language. Those strategies will also help to create a diverse environment.

          You can encourage children’s curiosity by:

          - putting unfamiliar items in treasure baskets
          - introducing new foods at mealtimes
          - using themed activities, such as festivals

          You can include commentary throughout these activities, which will ensure that children hear and learn new words.

          ##A cultural role play restaurant

          ![Children taking part in a food activity](/assets/4-3-2-3-477714449.jpg)

          You can give children access to cultural items that they are not familiar with for role play. You could arrange an area as a restaurant and then change it to reflect a range of different cultural cuisines. This gives children the opportunity to hear and use vocabulary about a wide range of utensils, foods and clothing.

          Adult led activity will give all children the opportunity to experience the correct pronunciation of item names. You can also include gestures and handling of the items to ensure they are using the correct vocabulary.

          You can then give children opportunities to use the area without an adult. This will give them the chance to practise the new language with their peers.

          You can extend this for older children and include visits to restaurants, food tasting or inviting visitors into the setting. This will also help to develop the children’s understanding of language and culture.

          ##Using pictures

          You could encourage parents and carers to bring in photographs of holidays and family celebrations. You can display the pictures and include them as part of discussions.

          Discussing personal pictures with a child will help their communication confidence by giving them a familiar focus and sense of pride. You can also use the pictures as part of larger group activities, or place them in a basket for children to access and discuss with each other.

          ![Children exploring a garden with a practitioner. One child is pointing at something interesting.](/assets/4-3-2-4-671254038.jpg)

          Taking part in outdoor interactions and activities will increase the variety of vocabulary that a child hears. Not all children will have access to outdoor areas at home, and those that do might experience them without adult interaction.

          You should plan vocabulary for outdoor activities in the same way that you do for indoor activities. This will make sure that the children to hear a wide range of vocabulary relating to:

          - tools
          - textures
          - sounds
          - living things

          For example, when children play outdoors with adult interaction, they will hear vocabulary about:

          - skills, such as jump, climb, skip, walk, balance
          - speed, such as quick, slow, steady
          - movements, such as slither, shuffle, wobble

          Without planning and teaching this vocabulary, children may develop the same skills. However, they may not experience or use the associated language. This is especially true if they play alone or without adult interaction.

          Children often feel a sense of freedom outside. This in turn increases their imagination, exploration and confidence to interact.

          ##Imaginative play

          Examples of outdoor imaginative play activities include:

          - mud kitchens
          - water play potions
          - setting up a campsite
          - digging for fossils

          Each experience will provide opportunities for children to hear new vocabulary about textures, smells, equipment and the processes they are using.

          ##Planting and growing

          Helping children to grow their own plants and food will provide lots of opportunities for the children to talk about:

          - the tools they are using
          - the texture of the soil
          - the bugs they find
          - how the items growing might look or taste

          ##Bug hotels

          You can encourage older children to work together to find the items they need to build a bug hotel.

          You can start discussions by asking questions like:

          - what do you think you need?
          - where might bugs like to live?
          - what will the bug hotel look like?
          - what conditions will it create?
          - how can you make it shady or keep the bugs dry?

          Children can look at books to consider the types of bugs that might live in their hotel. After the hotel is built, the children can visit regularly to see who has moved in.

          ##Weather or treasure walks

          Where possible, children should experience outdoor areas in all weathers.

          This will introduce new vocabulary about:

          - the temperature
          - the sounds, such as rainfall, birds, traffic, crunchy leaves, jumping in puddles
          - the colours and textures of the items they find

          For older children, walks can be used as an opportunity to make up stories about where they are travelling and what they might find when they get there.

          Reflect on what you have read about how the outdoor environment can support children's language development.

          Think about a recent outdoor activity and interaction with a child in your setting.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How did you include commentary before and during the activity?
          - How did you encourage discussion?
          - How did you include both an adult and child led focus?
          - How could you extend the activity further?

          Parents and carers play a crucial role in their child’s development. You should work with them to:

          - help them understand the importance of a language rich environment
          - share strategies for creating a language rich environment
          - make sure their child experiences a language rich environment at home

          The amount of support that children receive at home varies. You must understand each child's individual circumstances so that you can offer support.

          There are many ways you can work with parents and carers to help a child’s language development. When children see parents, carers and practitioners working together, it strengthens their relationships and promotes progress.

          ##Information gathering

          Parents and carers know their child best. They will be able to share lots of information to support you. You should try to find out about each child’s experiences, siblings and interests.

          This will enable you to:

          - use the names of familiar people, pets and places to encourage the child to engage in conversation
          - include familiar interests during storytime and discussions, so the child will communicate with increased confidence
          - build a sense of security, which will result in more confidence when communicating
          - develop the child’s self esteem, as they will feel valued and important
          - identify any additional needs and the support in place

          ##Building parents’ and carers’ confidence

          If parents and carers lack confidence with their own language skills, it might affect the language they use and share at home.

          You can help parents and carers to understand the importance of:

          - using commentary during everyday activities
          - not interrupting their child when they are are talking
          - reading to or with their child everyday
          - singing songs and rhymes to or with their child

          ##Sharing resources

          You can talk to parents and carers about the activities their child enjoys whilst they are in your care. If you let them know about the particular theme you are exploring, or that their child has enjoyed a specific activity, they can continue with this idea at home.

          You can also encourage parents to send items in from home. This will give a child the opportunity to share and talk confidently about an item or topic that they are familiar with.

          Parents and carers may not have access to resources like books and games at home. Or they may not realise that their child needs more challenge. Where possible you can send books, story sacks and song sheets home on a loan basis to encourage progress at home.  If a child needs further challenge, parents may benefit from your help with what resources and strategies to use.

          ##Inviting parents and carers in

          ![A male practitioner shakes hands with a female parent or carer as she arrives at a nursery. In the background, a group of children are sittng at a table completing an activity.](/assets/4-3-3-1a-2-1185682048.jpg)

          Where possible, you can invite parents into the setting. A child will take pride in sharing their learning environment with their parent or carer. Parents and carers will be able to observe examples of practice and activities that they can use at home.

          ##Resource packs for parents and carers

          It might not always be possible for parents to attend sessions. Instead, you could send resource packs home. These might include examples of activities you've done in the setting, and step by step guides to try out new activities at home. You could encourage parents and carers to take photos for their child to share.

          ##Celebrating success

          Success will look different for each child. It's important to look out for a child making efforts and improvements which you can praise. You should share these successes with parents and carers, so they can also recognise their child's development . Praise also helps a child to feel important and motivated to learn.

          $BRAIN

          Reflect on what you have read about strategies for working with parents and carers.

          Think about your practice.

          Consider the following questions:

          - How do you work with parents and carers to understand more about their children?
          - How do you build parents and carers' confidence and knowledge, so that they can support their children's language development at home?
          - What opportunities do you create to invite parents and carers in to your setting or share resources with them?
          - What impact do these strategies have on the children's learning and development?
          - How could you extend or improve on these strategies?

          It is important that you continue to share information about children’s language development with parents, carers and other professionals. This helps to ensure that the care and support the children receive meets their needs.

          ## Effective assessment

          You will be able to use your knowledge of child development and the individual child to make a professional judgement about:

          - what a child knows or can do
          - what you want a child to know or do
          - how you can support a child to achieve their milestones

          Effective assessment will also support you to identify where a child may have special educational needs, and so need more support.

          For an assessment to be effective, you should consider why you are doing it. You will need to consider:

          - what you want to know from the assessment
          - how the information gathered will be useful

          ## Effective collaboration

          You should share your assessment findings to ensure that children receive the most appropriate, high quality care for their needs.

          You should record the assessment information in line with your setting's requirements.

          You can then share this information, following confidentiality and safeguarding guidelines, with:

          - your colleagues
          - the child’s parents and carers
          - relevant professionals as appropriate, such as a SALT

          You should plan regular opportunities to listen to parents and carers, and to give them clear feedback about their child’s progress. The methods used to do this will vary depending on each individual setting.

          Examples could include:

          - opportunities for discussion during drop off and collection periods
          - sharing photos of children’s achievements
          - assessment updates at agreed points throughout the year
          - open house sessions, such as an afternoon or morning when parents are invited into the setting to engage in their child’s learning and progress

          It is important that you share information in a timely manner so that everyone involved in the child’s care has the most accurate information.

          Babies and children move through typical stages while they are developing their language skills. Understanding these typical stages will help you identify speech and language problems early.

          There are many theories about how children develop language and communication skills.

          It’s important to remember that theory is just that: theoretical ideas based on the research of an individual. Much the same as no one activity will suit the needs of all children, no one theory will influence how you support a child.

          There are also many different factors that can affect a child's language development, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of these factors can be both positive and negative.

          As a practitioner, you play a vital role in identifying and supporting children’s speech, language and communication needs. By combining your knowledge of each child with your professional judgement, you can make sure they receive the right support. This will prevent any potential gaps in development from happening or becoming worse. It will also ensure that every child receives high quality care.

          Speech and language skills are essential to support children’s personal, social and emotional development. Children with positive self-image will become confident communicators.

          To build their speech and language skills, all children need to experience a language rich environment that:

          - provides high quality interactions and activities
          - supports them to build their confidence
          - uses every opportunity for them to learn, rehearse and develop their language skills

          Your role is central to this. Children will learn from observing and copying your behaviour. As such, you should make sure to role model good communications.

          You should plan your curriculum to include lots of opportunities to:

          - introduce new vocabulary
          - help children practice and develop their language skills

          You should include:

          - adult led activities so you can use the appropriate interventions to support a child’s progress
          - opportunities for child led activities so children can test their new language skills

          You must also work with parents to support their child’s language development.
