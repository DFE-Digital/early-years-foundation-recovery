      intro: 
        heading: Supporting language development in the early years
        body: |
          On completion of this module, you will be able to:

          - identify and explore the stages of language development in the early years
          - review the potential factors that can affect language development
          - explain the impact of language skills on learning and behaviour
          - explain the importance of a language rich approach where interactions are promoted 

          The EYFS puts language at the heart of learning and development as it underpins all seven areas of development. The quality of the interactions and opportunities that children experience in the early years will form the foundations to promote success in later life. Children will thrive in an environment that is rich with opportunities for: 

          - story telling
          - singing
          - back and forth interactions
          - imaginative and creative play

          Children’s language experiences outside of your setting will vary and it is also important to remember that children will all develop at their own individual pace. As an early years practitioner, you can help children to learn, rehearse and use a rich range of language with confidence. You can provide children with a range of opportunities to do this through:
          - the activities you offer
          - the environment you provide 
          - being a good communications role model

      4-1: 
        heading: How children develop language and communication skills  
        body: | 
          The first 3 years of a child’s life are the most important for language and communication development.

          All children will develop at their own individual rate. If you understand expected development, you will be able to support each child’s journey.

          The first section of this module includes:

          - stages of language development
          - theories of language development   
          - factors affecting language development

      4-1-1: 
        heading: Stages of language development
        body: |
          Babies and children move through typical stages while they are developing their language skills. Understanding these typical stages will help you identify speech and language problems early.

          This topic includes:
          - the prelinguistic stage:
            - sounds and noises before talking 
            - effective practice 
          - the linguistic stage: 
            - one and two word sentences  
            - meaningful sentences 
            - fluent speech

          ##Before birth##
          
          In module 2, you learned that a baby’s language development begins as early as 20 weeks of pregnancy. At around 23 weeks most babies will start to hear sounds from outside the womb. 

          At birth a baby might recognise familiar voices, such as those of their parents and carers, and sounds they have heard during pregnancy. Their experiences in the womb may also mean that they recognise different tones such as male and female.

          As a practitioner, you can use knowledge of a baby’s background to comfort and care for the baby. For example if parents and carers have sung or played a specific piece of music to the baby, you can use this to help settle them if they become distressed. Other examples could include: 

          - knowing and using the names of family members, pets and places to engage the baby’s attention and encourage interactions
          - using knowledge of a child’s routine to support development – such as if a baby is more curious in outdoor environments or becomes distressed by large groups

          ##Pre-linguistic stage##

          The first year of life is known as the pre-linguistic stage. In this stage babies cannot yet speak and instead use sounds. 

          When a baby cries and you respond, they will feel that their attempts to communicate are working. This will encourage them to continue interacting with you.  As a baby grows, they will start to communicate in other ways. For example, as well as crying they might start: 

          - pointing 
          - making gestures, like rubbing their eyes 
          - smiling

          Language can be either expressive or receptive. A baby's receptive language, which is their ability to understand speech, develops before their expressive language, which is their ability to speak themselves. 

          They will also learn from your facial expressions and gestures. From around 2 to 4 months old a baby will react to different tones and volumes. For example, they might cry if a raised voice or noise startles them, and might gurgle or coo at a sound they find enjoyable.  

          ##Babbling stage##

          At around 6 to 8 months old most babies enter the babbling stage. This is where a baby will begin to make sounds such as ‘ba-ba’, ‘da-da’ and ‘ma-ma’. This is the way that babies learn, rehearse and develop future language skills. 

          Babbling will become more purposeful and the baby will try to imitate simple words. They will also begin to accompany their babbling with gestures. The babbling stage continues until a baby is around 12 months old.

        body: |
          ##Promoting language development with babies##

          You can promote language development in every aspect of a baby’s care. You should always acknowledge babies’ attempts to communicate, and responded to them positively. This will encourage babies to be enthusiastic about language and to make further attempts to communicate. You should also use babies names when talking to them. This will focus their attention on what you are saying, and help them to understand the content of your conversation.      

          ##Nappy changing##

          You can use mirrors or mobiles in a nappy changing area and talk to babies about what they can see and touch. For example you may say “Who can you see in the mirror? I can see your lovely blue eyes” or “Where are your ears? Can you touch your ears?” 

          Older babies can bring a toy with them, or you can offer a selection of toys. These will need to be toys that can be easily and regularly cleaned. You can then talk about the toy. For example, you might say “Do you have a brown horse? The horse has a lovely long tail” 

          You can also use your knowledge of the babies' families to talk about what they did on the way to the setting that day. Or, if you know that they have a family birthday, you could ask “Was it daddy’s birthday? Did daddy have a birthday cake?” You may simply discuss something  you can see, such as an item of clothing. For example, you could say “Look at your lovely tractor jumper! Mummy said you went to the farm. Did you see a tractor?”

          You can also talk through your actions, such as “Let’s take these shoes off so that we can change your nappy. We need to lift you up so I can take your trousers off.” 

          These examples will ensure that babies hear a steady stream of vocabulary, and help them make the connection between language and objects. 

          ##Meal and snack times##

          Bottle feeding is an opportunity to make eye contact and talk or sing to the baby. The conversations can follow the same types of themes as those you have while nappy changing. Even though you won't expect the baby to respond, it is still important to leave pauses. This helps babies start to understand the pattern of conversation. 

          Snack and mealtimes are a great opportunity to sit down with the babies and children and create a social situation. You can talk through your actions, such as “Let’s sit with our friends so that we can have some snacks” or “Look, we have strawberries. Let’s share them out with everyone”. 

          You can also talk to babies and children about the colours, shapes, and sizes of the food. You can address your comments to each of the babies, and create a conversation even when they do not respond. For example, you could say “Annie, do you like strawberries? Robert, Annie likes strawberries. Do you like them too? Annie, Robert thinks they are nice too.” You can reinforce this with positive facial expressions and appropriately placed pauses. This helps to teach the babies about conversational turn taking. 

          ##Outdoor play##

          Babies should have access to outdoor space where they can experience different sounds, smells and sights. You can take them on listening walks, where you talk to them about:

          - where you are going
          - what they can see
          - the sounds they can hear

          For example, you may narrate as you go along, telling them “This is the way we go to see the ducks. The birds are very noisy aren’t they?” or “Can you see the pretty yellow flowers? I think they smell very sweet."


          ##Activities##
          All of the activities you plan for babies will provide an opportunity for language development. This is because you can interact with the babies and comment on the resources being used, your actions, and the babies' actions. 

          ##Treasure baskets##

          You can provide babies with a wide selection of sensory items. This will promote opportunities to talk about what the items feel and look like. You can talk to babies about items being spiky, bumpy, furry, hard, or shiny. You will also be able to talk to babies about how they can use the items, such as by saying “Are you shaking the rattle?” 

          ##Music## 

          You can play rhymes and songs throughout the day. This will help to ensure children hear a wide variety of vocabulary. Engaging babies in singing will further support them to understand the language used. Songs that include actions, such as 'head, shoulders, knees and toes', will increase children’s connection between the word and the body part or item. 

          ##Stories##

          You can share a variety of books with babies, including:

          - fiction
          - non-fiction
          - picture books
          - sensory books, such as textured or lift the flap

          It is important to read to babies and allow opportunities for them to handle books, look at the pages and point to things they can see.  

          ##Toy telephones##

          Older babies will enjoy having a pretend phone conversation. This provides lots of opportunities for babies to learn about conversation turn taking. You can use your knowledge of the babies' families and interests to make lots of conversation.

          ##Messy Play##

          You can use materials such as pasta, jelly, water, sand and foam to create sensory activities for babies to explore. You can also add different items to the materials, such as toy animals or cars. Children can play seated in high chairs or as a larger group with a tuff tray. These activities allow for a large variety of comments and conversations. For example, you can talk about the toys, including their: 

          - textures 
          - smells
          - colours
          - sizes
          - materials
          - patterns

          You can also make comments about the adventures the toys might be going on. For example, you could add a toy dinosaur and talk about the noises it makes as it stomps through the jungle.
    
      4-1-1-2a:
        heading: 'The linguistic stage: one and two word sentences'
        body: |
          The linguistic stage generally begins when a child is 12 to 15 months old. In this stage, children begin to use words to express themselves. 

          ##The one word stage## 

          During the one word sentence stage, a child will use single words with non verbal clues such as gestures. For example, they might point whilst saying ‘ball’ to show that they want to play with the ball.

          By 15 months old, most children will be using around 10 words. They should also be able to point to the right body part when you name them. 

          By the age of 18 months old, most children will have a vocabulary of between 10 and 20 words.

          To begin with, a child will recognise and attempt to use nouns such as ‘dog’, ‘ball’ or ‘cup’. Next, they will start to understand verbs such as ‘drink’, ‘eat’ and ‘walk’. Understanding of adjectives such as ‘small’, ’red’ and ‘cold’ will follow.

          ##The 2 word stage##

          Around the age of 1 and a half to 2 years old, some children will be able to put 2 words together such as ‘car go’ or ‘doll walk’. 

          During this period children will experience great development of their comprehension skills. This means that children will understand what you are explaining or requesting. For example, if you mention it will soon be snack time, they might go to wait at the table where this takes place.

          To encourage a child to communicate, you can:

          - ask questions or comment on their activity while they are playing independently
          - leave pauses after you speak to show you are waiting for a response – this also helps children to understand the importance of turn taking
          - make your communication meaningful by asking about the item they are holding, or something you know will interest them

          It’s important to avoid using slang or nicknames that might confuse children, for example calling toes ‘piggies’ or dogs ‘bow wows’. 

          At the age of 2, most children can: 
          say 50 words
          understand between 250 to 500 words
          begin to follow 2 part instructions such as “get your cup and take it to the kitchen”
          put 2 word sentences together 

          ##Observing language development##

          When you are observing children’s development, you can use observation checkpoints from Development Matters. 

          Examples of checkpoints at this age include:

          “Around 12 months, does the baby ‘take turns’ by babbling and using single words? Does the baby point to things and use gestures to show things to adults and share interests?” 

          “Around 18 months, is the toddler listening and responding to a simple instruction like: ‘Adam, put on your shoes?’” (Development Matters, 2021)

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Talk your way through your day. This is exactly what it suggests. Make sure that you are describing your routine actions and explaining what is happening. You should use descriptive words to make sure that children use a wide variety of vocabulary. For example, if you preparing fruit for a snack, you can include words that describe the texture such as rough, smooth, sticky, or cold. You can then use this language again when the child is handling and eating the fruit. You can comment “you have picked a banana, is it squishy? Is it cold?” Children will then be able to make the connection between the word and the feeling.
            
            This will help children to:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>hear a wide variety of vocabulary</li>
              <li>connect the language to the item, task or situation</li>
              <li>organise and use their language in the correct way</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

      4-1-1-3: 
        heading: 'The linguistic stage: meaningful sentences' 
        body: |
          ##Telegraphic speech##

          Telegraphic speech is the last phase of language development before a child can speak fluently. This phase usually begins when a child is around 2 years old.  

          In this phase, a child can put together more meaningful sentences by combining individual words to get their point across. Their sentences will not be complete and will be missing connecting or descriptive words. 

          An example of telegraphic speech is: ‘cat drink milk’. You can repeat back what the child has said but with the correct grammar. For example, you could say ‘that’s right, the cat is drinking the milk’.

          ##Practicing and perfecting##

          From now on, a child will be continually developing their language skills through their interactions with others. Up until the age of 3, it is common for children to communicate by repeating back the things they hear. This is a normal part of language development called echolalia. Children usually stop doing this as they develop and use a wider vocabulary. 

          At the age of 3 most children can:

          - use a vocabulary of 300 words
          - understand up to 1000 words
          - understand language relating to concepts such as positioning, size and quantity
          - start to use plurals, such as ‘cats’ and ‘dogs’
          - start to use past tense, such as ‘played’ and ‘walked’
          - put a 4 to 5 word sentence together

          When you are talking to a child, you should:

          - make sure that they have at least 10 seconds processing time to consider their reply
          - try not to ask too many questions, as they may feel pressure and then not respond
          - comment on the child’s actions to ensure that they hear a wide variety of vocabulary – for example, “ you are pushing your baby very carefully”

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">You should provide lots of opportunities for children to share books. 
            
            When sharing books, you can:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>use both picture books and books with a range of simple and more complex text for children to follow</li>
              <li>encourage the children to point to items of interest and find the items you are talking about</li>
              <li>leave lots of pauses for children to share their thoughts and respond to your questions and comments</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">You should also find time to share books that children bring to you, as well as encourage the sharing of books between the setting and home. This will encourage children’s interests and likes, as well as their language development.</p>
          </div>

      4-1-1-4a:  
        heading: 'The linguistic stage: fluent speech'
        body: |
          At around 4 years old, most children can:

          - use around 1500 words
          - tell you about the function of items, for example using a scale to measure flour for cooking 
          - talk to you about past events
          - follow 3 part instructions such as ‘can you get a pencil, paper and scissors’
          - often use connecting words such as ‘because’, ‘and’, or ‘if’
          - use longer and more complex sentences

          You can use open ended questioning that challenges a child to give more detailed responses. For example, you could ask a child ‘why do you like going to the park?’. The child will need to give a more descriptive answer than if you had asked them ‘do you like going to the park?’, which would only need a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer.  

          You should help children to explain how situations make them feel and to name their feelings. For example, you could ask ‘how did you feel when you saw your new dog?’ and ‘why do you think he made you feel like that?’

          ##Correcting children’s language##

          When a child uses the wrong pronunciation or grammar, you should:

          - make sure that the child hears the correct language
          - not tell them that they are wrong

          You can do this by modelling the correct use of language. For example, a child may say ‘I drawed a picture for you’. Your response could be ‘that’s right, you have drawn a picture for me’. This provides an opportunity for the child to learn by imitation.

          ##Working with others## 

          Another way to support language development is by encouraging children to work with others to solve problems, take part in discussions and investigate. This is called sustained shared thinking. While working with others, a child will have extended discussions and ask and answer questions. This will give them lots of opportunities to hear and practice new vocabulary.

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Try setting up an experiment style activity to encourage sustained shared thinking. A good example is a homemade volcano using baking soda and vinegar.

      4-1-2: 
        heading: Theories of language development
        body: |
          There are many theories about how children develop language and communication skills.

          It’s important to remember that theory is just that: theoretical ideas based on the research of an individual. Much the same as no one activity will suit the needs of all children, no one theory will influence how you support a child.
          
          It is also important to fully consider criticisms of the theory and the findings from more recent research.

          Your approach to supporting children with their language development should be informed by the different theories rather than just one. 

          This topic includes the theories of:

          - Skinner
          - Chomsky
          - Piaget 
          - Bruner

          It is important to remember that these are the views of individuals, often from many years ago. You should also consider more recent research that supports and criticises these views.

          No one theory will be completely relevant to every child’s development. Being aware of theory will support you to approach planning and care with a balanced view.

      4-1-2-1: 
        heading: 'Theories of language development: Skinner' 
        body: |
          In Module 2, we looked at Skinner’s theory of how children learn. 

          His “behaviourism” theory has 3 principles:

          - imitation – where a child has the opportunity to observe and copy behaviour 
          - reinforcement – where a child receives a positive or negative response to their behaviour 
          - conditioning – where a child’s learning is shaped by their experiences

          He believed that these 3 principles apply to the development of all new skills, including language development.

          According to Skinner, children are born with a blank mind and develop their language skills by copying others. His theory argues that when a child copies someone, the response they receive will shape their future behaviour. This is known as reinforcement and conditioning.

          For example, if a child gets a positive response to using new language, they will be more likely to try to develop and use new language again. If the child receives a negative response, or no response at all, they might stop trying to communicate, to avoid the negative response. 

          ##Criticism of Skinner's theory##

          Skinner’s critics have highlighted a number of problems with the theory. Arguments opposing the theory include that:

          - all children follow a similar pattern of development through the 4 stages of cognitive development, regardless of the interactions or environments that they experience 
          - children cannot learn the grammar rules of language development through imitation alone
          - it is too simplistic and does not take cognitive development or individual needs into consideration

          One of the biggest critics of Skinner’s work is Noam Chomsky.

      4-1-2-2: 
        heading: 'Theories of language development: Chomsky'
        body: |
          Chomsky’s main belief is that language skills are essential for cooperation and survival. 

          He believes that: 

          - the brain is pre wired to learn and develop language
          - everyone has a ‘language acquisition device’ – an area of the brain responsible for language development
          - the 'language acquisition device' helps children to understand the rules of language

          Chomsky compared learning language to learning other skills. For example, all children are born with an understanding of how to walk and develop this skill through practice. Chomsky believes the same theory applies to language skills. His theory suggests that all children have the instinct and ability to develop language skills, regardless of how and where they grow up. 

          He argues that children do not learn language through imitation. His evidence includes that children make grammatical mistakes such as “I drawed” instead of “I drew". An adult wouldn’t say this, so a child could not have copied it. Instead, in this example, the child was testing their understanding of correct grammar.  

          Chomsky also believed that, whilst deaf children would not learn to speak in the same way as hearing children, they would still have their language acquisition device. This would help them learn to communicate with sign language. He argued that this supported his theory that all children are born pre-wired to communicate and understand language of some form.  

          ##Criticism of Chomsky's theory##

          Chomsky’s critics have highlighted a number of problems with the theory. Arguments opposing the theory include that:

          - there is no way to confirm that a language acquisition device exists within the brain 
          - research shows a distinct difference in children’s language skills depending on their background and experiences, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds on average 4 months behind their peers when they start school

          Piaget was the first person to carry out a systematic study of how children develop understanding. You looked at Piaget’s theory of cognitive development in module 2.

          According to Piaget’s theory, children do not think the way that adults do. He also argued that children are active learners who use experiences to learn. Piaget suggested that, as a child moves through the stages of cognitive development, they develop the logical thinking and reasoning skills needed to build their language skills.

          He explained that during the sensorimotor period (0 to 2 years old), a child’s language was for themselves. For example, during this phase, children make noises or accompany what they are doing with a few words. This is to make it a more enjoyable experience for themselves. Piaget explained that in this case, children do not need or expect a response from others around them. Piaget continued to say that, even when a child in this period receives a response, it will not affect or change their actions or further communication. He called this egocentric speech.

          During the pre-operational stage (2 to 7 years), Piaget suggested that children’s language skills improve rapidly. During this time a child is developing their mental schemas. These are mental maps which help them make sense of the world and understand the meaning of new words. Piaget explained that, from the age of 2, egocentric speech is slowly replaced by social speech.  He believed that this type of speech has more purpose as the child intends to interact with others. As a result, the child tries harder to make the communication successful by using the correct words and language structure.

          Piaget did not think that social and emotional relationships were important for language development. Instead, he believed that children need to understand a word before they can use it.

          This is why it is important to provide children with planned and adult led opportunities to develop and test their schemas.

          ##Criticism of Piaget’s theory##

          Piaget’s critics argue that he: 

          - places too much emphasis on a child progressing through the stages of development
          - overlooks the importance of the child’s learning experiences
          - underestimates a child’s abilities
          - does not recognise that a child could master a skill or learn a concept that belongs to an older age expectation

          This may lead to us not challenging children enough, as we may have low expectations of their ability. This is why it is important to be aware of each child’s individual abilities and plan effectively to provide appropriate challenge.

          You looked at Bruner’s theory of how children learn in module 2. He believed that both play and spending time with adults are vital to children’s learning.
          Bruner agreed with Chomsky that all children are born with a natural drive to learn language. However, he also argued that this drive alone was not enough. He thought that children also need lots of interaction with others to fully develop their language skills.
          Bruner called his research the social interactionist theory, and believed that: 
          children’s desire to communicate with others pushes them to learn the necessary language skills
          the quality of the social interactions that children experience will shape the quality of their language skills
          the environments a child experiences will impact on their language development 
          He explained that children need those around them to correct their language mistakes and scaffold their learning. He named these essential interactions as a language acquisition support system.
          Criticism of Bruner’s theory
          Bruner’s theory can question the criticisms of all of the other theories you have looked at. 
          For example, you have learnt that Piaget’s critics argue that he places too much emphasis on a child progressing through the stages of development, while overlooking the importance of the child’s learning experiences. However, Bruner acknowledges both the importance of learning opportunities and social interaction. 
          Chomsky’s critics argued that his theory did not take social background and experience into consideration. They also thought he focused too much on cognitive ability. However, Bruner acknowledges the relevance of both factors. 
          Skinner’s critics argued that children cannot learn the grammar rules of language development through imitation alone. They also said that his theory does not take cognitive development or individual needs into consideration. Bruner’s theory takes all of these points into consideration.
