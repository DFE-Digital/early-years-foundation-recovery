          On completion of this module you will be able to: 

            - establish and explore the stages of children’s brain development
            - explore the impact of brain development on children’s holistic development
            - examine the connection between brain development and children’s learning
            - define and evaluate the importance of effective relationships
            - explore a range of theories underpinning best practice 
            
          From birth to 5 years old, a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life. Brain development is a long process. The brain starts to develop around 2 weeks after conception and continues into adulthood.

          It’s important to understand developmental patterns and factors that can affect a child’s development. Both genetic and environmental factors impact on brain development.

          Brain development is also integral to a child’s ability to acquire and develop their language skills. As communication and language will underpin all other areas of development it is essential that we promote both brain and communication development.

          Being able to use **bold text** may be useful

          With poor markdown skills, it could be harder for CMS users to create:

          - bullet points
          - more bullet points
          - even more bullet points

          It could be even more difficult for them to create:

          1. numbered lists
          2. like
          3. this

          As we discussed in the introductory module all children develop at different rates and understanding developmental patterns and factors that can affect children will develop all aspects of your practice.

          # Working With Parents 

          Parents and carers are the child’s primary educator and have a wealth of valuable information that you can use to support their child effectively. Having good understanding of brain development will support you to further understand any information shared with you about the child’s overall health, well-being and development. 

          Being able to show parents that you understand the factors affecting their child will support you to build trust and a professional relationship which will ensure you are able to work together effectively and share experiences and strategies that will benefit the child.

          # Creating an Enabling Environment 

          It is important to remember that a child will take more benefit from being secure in an area of understanding than being exposed to more challenging concepts and tasks too early as a result of expected age related milestones. Children will need you to scaffold their learning as discussed in the introductory module. To do this successfully a child will need secure foundations to build upon. Understanding where a child needs to revisit concepts and experiences before moving on will be essential and will be influenced by your knowledge of the child and developmental patterns.

        heading: The developing brain
        body: |
          The first section of this module is about:

          -	the expected pattern of brain development before birth
          -	the expected pattern of brain development from 0 to 5 years
          -	factors affecting brain development
      1-1-1:
        heading: Brain development before birth
        body: |
          Babies’ brain development is a complex process that starts at around 2 weeks after conception and continues throughout pregnancy. 

          This topic looks at the expected pattern of brain development before birth and the factors that can influence it. It also includes how communication develops before birth. 
      1-1-1-1a:
        heading: Parts of the brain
        body: |
          ## Brain stem
          The brain stem at the top of your spinal cord where your head joins your neck. This is the most developed section of your brain at birth. This vital part of the brain controls your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.

          It also supports newborn reflexes such as crying, startling and sucking.
          
          # Cerebellum
          The cerebellum is at the back of your head. This is the area in charge of motor development. It controls balance and coordinates movements. The cerebellum combines the signals from the eyes, ears and muscles with motor commands.

          This is the area of the brain that supports babies to progress with motor skills such as the progression from rolling to crawling to walking. Repeating challenging activities helps this area of the brain to develop.

          # Frontal lobes
          The frontal lobes are located behind your forehead and are the largest part of your brain. They are involved in:
          - moral reasoning
          - critical thinking
          - planning ahead
          - decision making
          - impulse control
          
          The frontal lobes continue to develop until you are in your twenties or thirties- shaped by your experiences and environment.

          # Occipital lobes
          The occipital lobes are the back part of the brain. They allow us to make sense of information that comes from our eyes.

          At birth, the neural pathways used to carry the information from the eyes to the brain are not fully developed. Babies can only see 20 to 30 cm in front of them. To develop these neural pathways babies needs to use them,and they can do this by looking at a variety of objects. Babies’ vision improves steadily, and by 8 months they will see almost as well as an adult.

          # Temporal lobes
          The temporal lobes are at the side of your brain, just above your ears. One of their important functions is to help us understand and process sounds.

          Other functions include recognising faces and objects, as well as memory acquisition.

          It’s essential that a child is exposed to a wide variety of visual, auditory and practical tasks that enable them to test concepts and build memory skills.

          # Parietal lobes
          The parietal lobes are located behind the frontal lobes and above the temporal lobes. One of their main functions is to make sense of things we touch. They also tell us where our body is in relation to objects around us.

          # First trimester
          The neural plate - which is the basis of the nervous system - starts to form around 2 weeks after conception. It will grow longer and longer until it becomes the neural tube at approximately 5 weeks. At 6 weeks, the tube closes to become the brain and spinal cord. 

          When the tube does not successfully close and is left exposed to amniotic fluid, neural tube defects such as spina bifida can occur. 

          In this first trimester, the brain will grow millions of neurones. A neurone is a nerve cell. It carries electrical impulses from one part of the body to another to transmit information. Neurones do not connect physically. Where neurones meet, there is a gap called a synapse. Synapses begin to form from 7 weeks. 

          The first electrical activity in the brain starts at 8 weeks.This means the baby will begin to spontaneously move in the womb.  

          # Second trimester
          The brain develops rapidly during the the second trimester. 

          The brain stem will coordinate practice breathes as it directs compression of the chest muscles and movement of the diaphragm. 

          Movement will become more coordinated with increased kicking and stretching. 
          The brainwaves that occur during sleep form by 28 weeks and the baby will start to experience sleep cycles. 
          The brain stem is almost fully developed by the end of the second trimester 

          # Third trimester 
          A baby’s brain triples in weight during the third trimester. During this time, a fatty substance called myelin begins to coat the neurones. This is called myelination. and it increases the speed that electrical impulses can travel.

          # Ongoing development
          After birth, when a baby repeats and practices a skill, it leads to myelination of the neurones involved. This improves the speed at which the message travels and so improves the skill. 

          The brain will also get rid of old unused neurone pathways. It’s important for children to experience a wide variety of opportunities so that their neurones develop.

        heading: Influences on brain development before birth
        body: |
          There are a variety of influences and complications that can impact on brain development before birth. 

          # Illness in pregnancy
          When pregnant women have certain infections or illnesses during pregnancy, it can impact on their babies’ brain development. If a woman experiences chicken pox or measles during her pregnancy, it can lead to her baby having limb and brain abnormalities. In a very small number of cases, if a mother experiences pre-eclampsia, it can result in severe complications for the baby.
          
          # Smoking in pregnancy
          If a mother smokes during pregnancy, this increases the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. Cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen the baby receives and reduces the forming of neurones. This can result in an underdeveloped brain.  
          
          # Diet
          When a pregnant mother’s diet does not cover the energy needs of both mother and baby, this can lead to poor brain development. Taking folic acid supplements and eating foods rich in omega 3 can support brain development. 
          
          # Drinking alcohol in pregnancy
          Current NHS guidance is for a mother to avoid alcohol while pregnant. When a pregnant mother drinks alcohol it passes through the placenta to the baby. The liver is one of the last organs to fully develop. This means a baby will struggle to process the alcohol. This results in an increased risk of misscarriage, premature birth and developmental damage. 
          If a mother drinks while pregnant, their child may have Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). This can lead to issues for the child with:
          - speech and communication
          - learning and development
          - managing their emotions
          - developing social skills
          
          # Complications during labour
          Any complications during labour that result in prolonged periods of oxygen deprivation for the baby can result in brain injury.  Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy affects around 3 in 1000 births and can result in disabilities and tragically death.
