# Use YouTube as Video Hosting solution

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

How might we host video for incorporation into the module content

## Decision Drivers

* Infrastructure cost
* Integration with content
* Maintenance cost
* Impact if videos are publicly available outside of the module structure

## Considered Options

* Build a video hosting platform
* Contract with 3rd party to provide video hosting platform
* Private channel on YouTube

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Use YouTube. A private channel will enable the content to be viewed while making it harder to discover. Viewing video content out the context of the module, or out of sequence, is likely to be minimal. We neither have the time nor money to build or purchase a video viewing platform.
