        assessment_summary: ‘Overstimulation’ is the term used to describe the potential impact aspects of the environment such as noise, light, or crowds can have on children. 
        
        When children become overstimulated, their responses may be interpreted as challenging or unwanted behaviour. In your setting, children will benefit from a designated quiet area that they know they can retreat to if things become too much. A knowledge of children’s interests can also be helpful here, as they can be used as a distraction.

        assessment_summary: Redirection is an effective strategy for children aged 18-36 months, as redirection strategies will help to shape and guide their behaviour. For example, instead of telling a child “don’t shout”, you could say “can we talk quietly please? Your friends are sleeping”. This is because asking the child not to shout does not guide them to the behaviour you are looking for, or explain why you need them to behave differently.

        label: How many stages of separation anxiety did Bowlby identify?
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: Bowlby identified 3 stages of separation anxiety. 
        
        In the first stage, protest, children may scream, kick, show anger and try to escape. 
        
        During the second stage, despair, it may seem as though children have accepted the separation. However, they will appear withdrawn and may display self-soothing techniques. 
        
        In the third and final stage, detachment, children may lose their trust in people. Bowlby suggested that this stage will apply when children are separated from their most significant attachment for a longer period of time.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: When there is effective communication between practitioners and parents, everyone caring for the child will have a full understanding of their needs, preferences and level of development. This will support better understanding of both the child’s current skills and the plan to promote progress. When everyone has realistic expectations, the child will have the freedom to learn in supportive environments.

        label: True or false? Visual reminders will positively support children to develop their self-regulation skills.
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: Visual reminders can help children to develop their self-regulation skills. For example, a child may call out every time they have a thought as they struggle to control the impulse to share the information. A visual reminder to put up their hand and wait, or write their thought down until a more appropriate moment, will help the child to remember the appropriate behaviour for the situation.
