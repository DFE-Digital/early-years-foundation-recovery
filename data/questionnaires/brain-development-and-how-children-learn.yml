          Research shows that children living in low income households are 3 times more likely to experience mental health issues and have lower academic success than children from more affluent backgrounds.Coming from a disadvantaged area or a household in poverty should not restrict a child’s chances to succeed. Being able to identify where a child requires support and addressing individual needs is essential to ensure the child can continue to progress.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          A positive learning environment includes a balance of both adult and child led experiences. Children need to learn and receive guidance from adult interaction, but they also need time to process and explore the knowledge learnt through child initiated activity.

          "‘Cognitive development delay’ means that a child is at a lower level than the expected milestone. No child should ever be considered to be low ability, and every child is able to progress and achieve with the correct support. Maintaining your knowledge of expected development milestones will ensure you are able to intervene early and offer appropriate support to ensure every child can progress.
