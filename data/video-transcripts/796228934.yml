  Abraham Maslow was an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Maslow believed that for children to learn and develop effectively, their basic needs had to be met.

  This hierarchy of needs is often shown as a pyramid. The most important needs are physiological such as food, sleep, and shelter, and are at the bottom of the pyramid.

  If a child feels tired, stressed, or scared, their brain will focus on this which may make it more difficult for them to learn.

  In your setting, you might notice that children find it more difficult to concentrate closer to sleep time or towards the end of the day. They might be less engaged during story time or when playing with peers.

  Children who are hungry may also be less engaged, especially if they're unsure when their next meal will be. You might see children being less patient when waiting for their turn to talk.

  Practitioner: "Shall we let him have a turn?

  Or find that children need your support to help them manage their feelings.

  Practitioner: "Gentle hands."

  That's why it's important for you to have a routine in your setting.

  Practitioner: "♪ Brush your teeth in the morning and night ♪"

  When children are familiar with the routine, they can relax into the learning taking place without fear or worry.

  The next stage of the pyramid is safety needs. In your setting, children need to have consistent boundaries and expectations for their behaviour.

  Practitioner: "To get to the green zone and to be calm and ready, and to feel happy for our story book shall we take three big, deep breaths?"

  They can then predict the responses they'll receive from you. This will help them to feel more confident and relaxed, allowing them to concentrate on learning.

  The next stage of needs is social belonging. It's important that you help all children, no matter what their pattern of attachment may be, to feel safe and secure. Ensuring they feel safe and secure in the learning environment will help them to immerse themselves into learning.

  Practitioner: "Which animal are we going to choose?"

  It will also encourage resilience in stressful and challenging situations...

  Practitioner: "You can have a go in a minute."

  ...as well as allow them to regulate their emotions and manage their responses appropriately.

  Practitioner: "Can he have a turn?"

  Practitioner: "Good boy!"

  Providing children with consistent boundaries and responses will help them to express their needs.

  Practitioner: "Excellent walking up the stairs, you guys."

  They will also have higher levels of confidence and self-efficacy, which will promote motivation and enthusiasm when learning.

  Supporting children to build positive relationships with those around them will allow them to focus on the learning opportunities being offered by you or your colleagues. The next stage of needs is self-esteem. During this stage, children need others to help them to feel important and valued.

  Practitioner: "Good job!"

  In your setting you should take appropriate opportunities to recognise and praise children.

  Practitioner: "Yay, well done."

  Children who feel their interactions will be valued are more likely to contribute to learning.

  The final stage of needs is self actualisation. When you've met as many needs as possible, children will be able to fully relax into their environment and make the most of learning opportunities.
