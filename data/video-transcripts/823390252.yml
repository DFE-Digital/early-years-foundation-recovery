# Activities to support physical development

  It's really important to be able to provide a range of activities for children to explore their environment so that they have opportunity to develop their gross and fine motor skills. What we're going to see now is some examples of that with a range of practitioners in different settings.

  So through our assessment and our observations, we've realised that our children need to build up on their core strength and their fine motor skills.

  So we've introduced tummy time to all the children. And we start off with a small piece of dough. We do a lot of exercise and that strengthens the fingers, showing children different actions.

  And once we've done that we ask children to lay down onto their tummies and start drawing horizontal lines or vertical lines or circles, so that they can build on that core strength.

  It's helped a lot of children, especially the younger ones, the 2 year olds, who we feel are just a bit unstable.

  This week we are focusing on a story about tigers, so we're looking at stripes. The children are using brushes to make stripes going up and down to strengthen their upper body, to help them eventually in holding pencils and writing.

  One of the other activities is weaving. So we're weaving stripes in and out, under, over, to help their fine motor skills, again, which will support and help them in holding tools that are necessary for the children to be able to make marks.

  We do a great activity with the parachute with the children. The children gather round it, we wave the parachute up and down. Children really enjoy counting along when we throw the die on, and it's a great way to build their muscles and it's a maths activity as well.

  One of the activities we do is music and movement to scarves. As soon as children come in, we encourage them to be independent, to go and get their scarves. They then go and find a space and they copy the practitioner and dance to the music.

  The activity really promotes spatial awareness, upper body strength, and all sorts of body movements, both gross motor and fine motor skills, and all round body co-ordination.

  Outside, we do painting, but we have a very, very tall blackboard that the children use radiator paintbrushes and they stretch as high as they can and as wide as they can. And it doesn't matter what ability they are, they can all achieve. And the sense of achievement for the children is brilliant.

  We have 2 members of staff that take the children to the forest school where initially they're encouraged to suit and boot, to put their suits on themselves and put their wellies on.

  Suiting and booting is very important for children's development because it encourages them to use their whole body.

  They are lifting their legs, putting their feet in, putting their arms through, and then buttoning up, zipping up. All these help them with their gross motor skills and their fine motor skills and eventually it makes them very independent.

  The children really enjoy doing sports races outside. We do a sack race which is developing their core muscles through jumping in a sack.

  We do lots of egg, spoon races which are great for hand-eye co-ordination. We also do the beanbag race which develops their balance. And all of these skills are helping to develop their upper body as well.
