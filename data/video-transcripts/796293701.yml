  Practitioner: "Are you rocking it?"

  The development of children's spoken language underpins all seven areas of learning and development.

  Practitioner: "Shall we have a look?""

  As a practitioner, it's key that from an early age you provide babies with opportunities to hear, learn and rehearse speech sounds.

  Practitioner: "What noise does the cow make? He says 'moo'."

  This will support the development of their language skills. When working with babies you should always encourage their attempts to communicate.

  Practitioner: "Where's it gone?"

  Practitioner: "On top and down below."

  You should also aim to build their understanding and the range of words they hear.

  Practitioner: "Are you going to shake that?"

  For example, a baby may babble whilst holding a rattle as a sign they want to communicate with you. A positive response such as smiling will encourage them to keep trying. Your response could introduce new words and expand the vocabulary they're hearing.

  Practitioner: "It is, have you seen your face?"

  Practitioner: "Big smiles."

  You can also use resources such as story books. As you're looking at the pictures and reading the words you can point to the relevant items on the page. This will encourage their understanding of objects.

  If you're reading a book and a baby points at an object and babbles...

  Practitioner: "Strawberries, can you say strawberries?"

  ...you can respond by verifying what the object is...

  Practitioner: "Strawberry."

  ...and then asking a follow up question.

  Practitioner: "What's your favourite?""

  Even though the baby may not be able to say that particular word, teaching them what the object looks like and what it sounds like will help to develop their vocabulary and understanding.

  Practitioner: "♪ Shake and shake and shake and stop ♪"

  Singing to babies and playing music will also help to develop their vocabulary and encourages learning in a stimulating and fun way.

  Practitioner: "Well done."

  Providing them with musical instruments and objects that make a noise also give you opportunities to use descriptive language.

  Practitioner: "♪ Bang on the drum as we march along ♪"

  Practitioner: "Do the bells ring?"

  For example, do the drums crash? Does the bell ring?

  You can also introduce language about actions needed to create the sound.

  Practitioner: "Shake the rattle."

  Practitioner: "♪ Don't forget to roar ♪"

  Songs that include repetition, actions, or noises encourage babies to rehearse and develop their understanding of words.

  Practitioner: "Yes."

  Another way you can encourage a baby's attempt to communicate is by narrating your everyday actions.

  Practitioner: "Shall we go for nappy time? Shall we go find your nappies and wipes? Yes. Let's go then."

  This will support a baby's understanding of their everyday life and will ensure that they have opportunities to learn, rehearse and develop future language skills.

  Promoting new language in everything you do as part of a baby's care, will provide them with a positive start in their communication development.

  Practitioner: "Oh, good balancing. Oh, all fall down."
