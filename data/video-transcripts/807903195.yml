  Brain development begins in the first few weeks after conception. The neural plate is the basis of the nervous system and begins to form around 2 weeks after conception.

  Over the following weeks, it grows longer and longer until it becomes a neural tube at approximately 5 weeks.

  At 6 weeks, the neural tube closes to form both the brain and the spinal cord.

  The brain separates into 3 distinct parts, the front brain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain.

  From here on, the brain will grow millions of neurones.

  A neurone is a nerve cell, which carries electrical impulses from one part of the body to another to transmit information.

  The first electrical activity in the brain starts at 8 weeks. This means the baby will begin to make small movements in the womb. However, the mother won't feel these movements yet.

  The brain continues to grow and develop rapidly. By 10 weeks, it now makes up almost half the baby's weight.

  During the second trimester, the baby's brain directs the diaphragm and chest muscles to contract and perform practice breaths.

  By 13 weeks, neurones start to send messages that result in basic reflexes. For example, the baby will start to open and close their fingers and curl their toes.

  The most rapid part of the baby's brain development occurs in the middle of the second trimester as up to 250,000 neurones are created every minute.

  At 20 weeks, these neurones begin to be coated in myelin, a protective insulation that speeds up the electrical impulses along the nerve cells. This continues growing until the baby's first birthday.

  Around 20 weeks is also when the baby can hear sounds and begin to recognise their mother's voice.

  By week 26, the brain stem is almost fully developed. This will control the baby's heart rate, breathing, swallowing and blood pressure.

  At 28 weeks, the baby will begin experiencing sleep cycles, including rapid eye movement and may even start dreaming, and neurones are now making connections with the baby's organs. This means their senses, including hearing, sight and smell, begin to function.

  During the third trimester, the baby's brain triples in size. The smooth surface of the brain develops folds and grooves, increasing the surface area. This makes space for even more neurones.

  By the time the baby is born, around week 40, the brain looks more like an adult brain and has most of the neurones they will have for the rest of their life.

  Over the next 5 years, millions of connections form between these neurones, and the brain will grow to almost 90% of its adult size.

  This rapid development explains why a child's early years are crucial in helping them learn, develop, and grow into healthy and successful adults.
