# Creating an environment that supports physical development

  It's really important to plan your environment for physical development. You have to really look at what space and resources that you've got, but understand that they can be adaptable.

  You can adapt the activities to the space to make sure that you meet those needs for gross and fine motor skills. And now we're going to see some examples of how practitioners use their own space.

  We set our nursery up into four age-appropriate rooms so each room has got furniture and activity-based resources that the children are more familiar with, with their age.

  So as they move through the nursery and transition, they're stretched and challenged to do more physical development with different sort of utensils, going from chunky chalks to pencils and things like that.

  We have furniture so children can climb in and out, develop those gross motor skills, things like home corners being all at the children's level.

  And the outside area always being a positive, welcoming environment, so sandpits, bats, balls, climbing frames, things that the children are naturally very interested in that builds on all of those physical development skills.

  We've developed a kitchen area for our children where they go and prepare their own snacks. They make their toast, butter the toast, pour their own drinks. We have little captain chairs for children who struggle with their core so it's helping them sit down.

  Our baby room is planned around the baby's physical development needs. So we have age-appropriate furniture, everything's at the children's level, it's open plan, it's quite natural so it's not overwhelming. And staff provide that influence over the children to be able to try new things as well.

  So we have lots of sensory play so they can experience sight, smell, sounds. Going outside as well, walking on different terrains, getting to know climbing, slides, providing them time to come in and ultimately have fun but develop those physical needs too.

  We have a construction area where the children have a variety of different sizes of blocks they can use for balancing, for imaginative play, and to help them with their physical skills, their upper strength, their lower strength.

  Some like to use the foam blocks and they like to build, build, build, build, build till they get to their height, or they like to go higher than what they are. And the others just like to just generally build a road or a bridge. And that's aiding their upper body strength and their core strength, and their gross skills.

  We've created an obstacle course outside. They can use their gross motor skills to explore different heights and levels using planks and crates and boxes.

  This helps them because they can jump, they can use their arms and their legs to climb and navigate different areas, different heights, and then they can explore safety and dangers as well with the support of a practitioner.

  The outside space for our nursery is very, very important to us. The children learn to use all parts of their body.

  We have the big playground where the children self-select the activities that they are interested in doing. We have got bicycles, so the children are pedalling. Some of them don't have pedals, so they have to use their feet. There's climbing apparatus that they climb over, under, slide down.

  And then we've got the outdoor mark-making area where the children are also using large brushes to make marks.

  They've also got running space. This space is wonderful for them to be able to use their whole body and just be children and play and enjoy themselves.
