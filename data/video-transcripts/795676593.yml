  In this video, practitioners explain how a successful environment can create lots of opportunities for interaction and for children to hear and use language skills.

  The practitioners are:

  - Rahima, class teacher
  - Melissa, teacher
  - Fliss, teacher
  - Zara, early years educator
  - Karla, childminder
  - Adam, class teacher

  Rahima:

  A well-planned learning environment both inside and out will aid your role as practitioner and enhance high quality play.

  Practitioner: “That's it. Well done.”

  Providing children with a rich language environment, for example, by sharing books, will create a wealth of opportunities for children to hear and use language across all areas of learning.

  Let's get some examples of how some practitioners have worked towards a language rich environment.

  Melissa:

  The most important thing is a warm and responsive relationship.

  Child: “Lion”

  Practitioner: “The lion”

  So if that warm and responsive relationship is established, that means that communication can happen in a meaningful social context and that means that language is much richer.

  Fliss:

  One of the ways in which we encourage a language rich environment is really focusing on the quality of interactions, thinking about those sustained back and forth conversations.

  Fliss: “You've got brown eyes.”

  Child: “I know.”

  Fliss: “You've got brown eyes as well.”

  So we use high quality picture books to enable those conversations to happen between adults and children, and children and children.

  Child: “Five!”

  Fliss: “Five!”

  We've been focusing on using mathematical picture books. So books that have a wonderful story, but also contain a rich mathematical theme to develop rich mathematical vocabulary.

  Fliss: “So look, there are five.”

  Zara:

  One approach that I constantly use to support children's language is through shared book reading.

  Zara: “Big dark forest”

  This is a fantastic way for me to introduce new words to children, explain the meaning, and give them understanding to these words.

  Zara: “A snow storm. A swirling, whirling snow storm.”

  Knowing your children for this is so important, and knowing to pitch it just above the child's current learning level.

  So if I know the child knows one word, then I can expand and add another word that's adding to their learning and their vocabulary.

  Zara: “What can we see?”

  Child: “Grass.”

  Zara: “Grass. Long, wavy grass.”

  Karla:

  We constantly talk to the children and they constantly talk back to us. We name objects when we're out and about.

  Karla: “What can you hear? What can you hear?”

  Child: “It's a car.”

  We give children all the vocabulary that they need during their play.

  Karla: “Which one's the heaviest now? The bark or the weights?”

  Child: “The weights.”

  We narrate their play, giving them the adjectives so that they can start to build their sentences.

  Karla: “What do you think they might do at the park?”

  Child: “Play at the park.”

  Karla: “Playing at the park. I think monkeys are very good at swinging, aren't they?”

  We play board games with them. There's a particular game that they love where they choose a card, they name what they see.

  Karla: “What's this one?”

  Child: “Cheese.”

  Karla: “A cake.”

  Adam:

  And then they just post it in a post box and then the next child has a turn. I use lots of synonyms. ‘That's a big car. It's huge. It's massive.’

  Adam: “That's a big piece of snow that crumbled off. He used the rake like a claw.”

  Lots and lots of different words to describe things. The other really important thing is defining words.

  Adam: “We went to see the librarian, and the librarian is the person who looks after the library, and we gave our card to the librarian and he let us take the books home.”

  So instead of showing a picture and saying, that's the shopkeeper, I will tell them what a shopkeeper is.

  Adam: “The shopkeeper is the person who works in the shop, and he's the one that we pay, and we buy the things that we need.”

  Defining words for children helps them extend their conversation beyond naming things, and that really helps children have proper full conversations with each other and with other adults as well.

  Rahima:
  Across your setting, there are lots of opportunities to create language rich environments including through books, imaginative play, and the layout of rooms.

  Considering these areas amongst others will help aid positive interaction and children's curiosity.
