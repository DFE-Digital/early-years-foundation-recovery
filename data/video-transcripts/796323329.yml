  This video explains how settings have successfully worked with parents and carers to support the home learning environment.

  The home learning environment can have a substantial impact on a child's development. This includes their early speech, language and communication skills, as well as their social and emotional development.

  It is important to work alongside parents and carers to share information and suggestions of how they can support their child's development at home.

  Practitioner: “And how are you using the core board at home?”

  Parent: “Oh yeah, it's really going well. He is getting used to it.”

  Let's hear now from some practitioners about how they have successfully worked with parents and carers to support the home learning environment.

  Julian:

  We first of all, always listen carefully to parents. We learn about what they're doing at home, and that builds that respectful partnership. We use WhatsApp and other ways of sharing ideas for parents to follow some of the things that their child has been doing here in nursery.

  And we found that simplifying it, thinking about chatting, playing, reading, has helped us to focus that message really well with the parents.

  Fliss:

  From research we know that what parents do with their children is really important, so that is so vital for us to communicate that message effectively, to empower parents to support their children's play and learning, conversations while you go about your daily routine, but also we really focus on encouraging parents to read with their children, share stories.

  Practitioner: “Reading to understand what words are is a really rich activity to do.”

  Sing songs and crucially have those wonderful rich back and forth conversations about things that are important to them.

  Practitioner: “And I really encourage you to do that at home. Really paying attention to what he's interested in and having those back and forth interactions.”

  Adam:

  Children are only with us for a few hours a day, so it's really important that we work with parents to support the children's home learning.

  One of my children who was with me last year, his parents wanted him to switch to a morning provision in order to get him ready for school.

  So we worked really hard together to get his bedtime earlier in small increments so he had enough sleep in order to be fresh and ready for learning in the morning.

  Zara:

  Working in partnership with parents is key to children's overall learning.

  Getting a bigger picture and finding out what's happening at home and seeing if it aligns with what I see as a practitioner, and if it doesn't providing strategies for parents to use at home.

  So this could include commenting on children's play, getting down to their level while they're playing and having back and forth conversation.

  Karla:

  So it's really important for me to share information with parents. An example of a really important communication would be maybe using scissors in a setting.

  A lot of parents don't realise that their children can actually use scissors and by having that experience here it's sharing that information with the parents. They may feel more comfortable to do that at home with their children and to help them to develop their skills further.

  Parent:

  So really great moments for us are when the childminder talks about his day, she gives me a debrief about what they've been up to and how he's interacted with other children. And when I'm able to take those learning experiences home with me.

  So for example, when he's been cooking or baking or making soup, or something more simple about his language, things that I can kind of build on at home that I know that he's learned because she tells me so much stuff about his day.

  Parent:

  So our experience has been that our childcare has helped our parenting and that's important because we're quite inexperienced and new parents and the stuff that our child might be doing, we get reassured by our childcare providers how he's doing and how he's developing.

  And that means that when we go home we know about how he's developing in himself and we can then bring that into our parenting at home.
