  In this video we hear from a childminder talking about how social interactions, cultures and the environment play a significant role in children’s development.

  Hi, I'm Karla. I'm a registered childminder and I run a small childcare practice from my home in Northamptonshire.

  As a practitioner, it's so important to ensure you plan time for children to explore and master new skills.

  While the value of independent learning should not be underestimated, it's also important that children observe knowledgeable and trusted adults or be guided by an adult who has a greater understanding, a more knowledgeable other.

  “Oh. Look at that.”

  In my setting, I plan new vocabulary I want children to learn and understand. For example, I have one child at the moment who is interested in cutting up different materials and shapes so I introduce words that relate to the activity they are doing.

  “Snip.”

  This helps them to widen their word bank and develop their understanding of new concepts.

  “Close and open.”

  Whilst doing something they enjoy. Turn taking activities, such as cooking, support the personal, social and emotional development for all children in my care.

  When a group of children collectively enjoy an activity, this supports the concept of taking turns. It also helps children to feel more confident to take turns independently. My role is to observe and only intervene if needed. And because I'm there, children feel safe to take turns and play fairly.

  If necessary, any guidance given by me as the more knowledgeable other will help them resolve conflict. During child led activities I may notice a child needing support.

  “Where does this one go?”

  I need to give just enough support to encourage them to continue.

  “Test and see.”

  But not too much and risk them disengaging.

  “Well done.”

  Sometimes good opportunities may arise to give one of the children the role of the knowledgeable other. During adult led activities children observe me modelling new skills.

  For example, in a painting activity I show the children how to make a print. Then they have a go themselves. The support lessens as a child becomes more competent.

  This is where it's important for activities to be available in the continuous provision where children have time to explore and master their new skill. I scaffold their learning to support them to learn new skills with help from others around them.
