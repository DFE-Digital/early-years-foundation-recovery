# Development of gross motor skills
---
transcript: |
  Physical activity is vital for babies and children's all-round development, enabling them to pursue happy, healthy, and active lives.

  Whilst babies and children will develop at different rates, development of their gross motor skills follow typical stages.

  At around 3 or 4 months, most babies will begin to roll over.

  At around 6 months, most babies will begin to sit unsupported.

  Between 7 and 10 months, most babies will begin to crawl.

  Some babies may find an alternative way to travel, such as shuffling on their bottom. Not all children will crawl before they walk.

  Between 9 and 12 months, most babies will begin to pull themselves up against an item for support. Babies will then usually begin cruising, which is where they move along, holding onto furniture.

  Between 12 and 18 months, most children will take their first steps. Once they can move around, you can encourage them to be as active as possible in a supervised environment.

  Between 18 and 24 months, most children will progress from walking to running, and by 36 months, most children will be jumping, kicking, and throwing.

  Being physically active every day is important for the development of babies and children.

  Babies up to the age of 1 should be encouraged to be active throughout the day.

  This can include reaching and grasping, moving their head, body, and limbs during daily routine and during supervised play.

  Activity should also include 30 minutes of supervised tummy time spread throughout the day when they are awake.

  From the age of 1, as children develop their physical skills, they should be active every day for at least 180 minutes, including light activities such as standing up, rolling around, and playing, as well as more vigorous activities, such as running, jumping, dancing, and riding a bike.

  From the age of 3, this 180 minutes should include 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, including active and outdoor play. The more activity, the better.

  Whilst there are typical stages babies and children move through in order to develop their physical skills, all children develop at different rates and have different starting points.

  Children who have not had the same opportunities as their peers to practise these skills may need extra support from you to enable them to develop the same skills and confidence. As a practitioner, it is important that you recognise individual starting points and needs, and plan how to support each child to reach their full potential.
