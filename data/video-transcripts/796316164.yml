  This video explains how practitioners could apply theory to their practice and the impact that can have.

  The theorists, Bruner and Skinner, emphasised the importance of the adult's role in children's language and communication development.

  As a key person in your setting, it is important that you and other adults interacting with the children are good communication role models.

  Practitioner: “Shall we put the book back in?”

  Children will observe and listen to you, and copy your behaviour.

  Practitioner: “Well done!”

  You should think about your tone, volume, and pace, to ensure it suits not only the environment and the activity, but also the children's needs and the type of message you are conveying.

  Practitioner: “Can you tell him?”

  You should plan different activities to show different types of communication. For example, during indoor small group activities, you should model using quieter voices.

  Practitioner: “Wriggle, wriggle. Can you wriggle your fingers?”

  And you can use story time to change your tone, to show feelings such as excitement or sadness. If you expect the children to use calm, controlled voices even when they are frustrated, you will need to do the same.

  Practitioner: “Gentle hands”

  Skinner believed that the response a child received to their communication attempts was important.

  Practitioner: “Where's it gone?”

  He suggested a positive response would make a child want to communicate more.

  Practitioner: “Well done! Good copying.”

  As a practitioner, you should therefore acknowledge all attempts babies and children make to communicate.

  Practitioner: “You knocked it down.”

  You can do this by using positive facial expressions, where appropriate making eye contact, verbal praise, and by responding with open-ended questions such as:

  Practitioner: “What do you think Lulu is going to do next?”

  Piaget discusses the importance of the environment and a child's need to learn and understand vocabulary, in order to use language effectively.

  Practitioner: “♪ If you're happy and you know it, pop the bubbles ♪”

  Practitioner: “Pop, pop, pop”

  You can do this by narrating your actions, and naming the objects children encounter in their environment.

  Practitioner: “Aeroplane up in the sky, high in the sky.”

  This will help them relate the spoken language you use to the objects around them.

  Practitioner: “Bye, bye! Bye, aeroplane.”

  The role of the practitioner is equally important, according to Chomsky, who believed that, although children were born ready to learn language…

  Practitioner: “Oh, what have you found?”

  …they need adults to support them to learn, practise, and develop skills.

  Practitioner: “I wonder what noises elephants make.”

  That's why you should plan a curriculum offering lots of different opportunities for children to hear a wide range of vocabulary. This could include activities that promote imagination, like role play…

  Practitioner: “I'm going to put it in the oven.”

  …as well as storytelling and discussion.

  Where attempts to communicate are not made, it is important for the adults to make the first move to encourage them.

  These theories show us the importance of using language-rich practice within an effectively-planned environment to fully support children's language development.
