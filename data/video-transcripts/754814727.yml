  Sophie, family worker:

  "It's been more important than ever that we really truly understand what life has been like for children over the past 2 and a half years.

  "Children have experienced all kinds of adversity, so now more than ever, it's critical that we think about what life has been like for them and think about how we are best going to support them and think deeply about their wellbeing."

  Kerry, senior family worker:

  "Well what we know is that children have actually been isolated in their home environments, have possibly not even been around extended family and have only been with primary caregivers. And then all of a sudden we are expecting them to come out into the big wide world and it's very scary."

  Sophie:

  "We develop strong relationships with children because fundamentally they may have only experienced a
  relationship with their immediate family. So for them this could be the first relationship outside of their kind of secure base at home.

  "So it's important that we start slow and we build on that to ensure that they believe and know that adults outside of their home environment are available and are there for them."

  Louise, senior family worker:

  "Post COVID a lot of children are really anxious and haven't had a lot of social interactions, so we're well aware of that as a team. We will tune into children's individual interests, and before they come into nursery we'll set up things that we know that they've enjoyed doing at home, so hopefully that'll be something familiar from home into nursery.

  "Also being mindful of children being left by their parents, which they may not have been during COVID, so maybe making up lovely photograph books of families about the sequence of where their mum's at that day, what they're doing, that mirrors each other's days.

  "That's helped with a lot of children and just being emotionally available for children, so we just have to be so in tune with the children's needs, getting to know them, learning about their wellbeing and being there for them."

  Sophie:

  "Relationships start from the initial home visit and we get to know the children by finding out all the little details that are important to them. 

  "It has been really important for me to think deeply about the relationship that I have with children and about how I can hold them in mind.

  "So "What's important for you?" If you've told me something the day before, it's important that I remember that and then I talk to you about that the next day because that is a way of building trust and letting you know that actually I'm there for you and I'm listening and I'm available for you."

  Hannah, family worker:

  "As a staff team we have thought about our settling in period post COVID. We have always been passionate about an extended time for children to settle. This has usually been 2 weeks. However post COVID we are finding children need more time."

  Kerry:

  "Children's emotional wellbeing is paramount to everything. Children need to feel secure and comfortable and supported, to be able then to go on and do any other further learning and have any significant impact on their development moving forward."

  Hannah:

  "Within nurseries, we support children to feel a sense of belonging by having pictures of them on the walls.

  "We all have a family group, so each child has their beautiful smiling face on the wall and we come together twice a day as a family group to share what we've been doing, share stories, so that they have a real sense of a small community, that then they'll be able to go off into the wider nursery environment with confidence from fostering that relationship with ourselves as family workers and their small family group."
