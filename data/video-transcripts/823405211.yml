# Development of fine motor skills
---
transcript: |
  Babies and children move through typical stages while developing their physical skills.

  Fine motor skills involve small muscles working with the brain and nervous system to control movements. These happen in areas like the hands, fingers, lips, tongue, and eyes.

  Fine motor skills are needed for activities like eating, manipulating objects, and getting dressed. For the first three to four months, babies' fists will remain tightly closed.

  If you uncurl their fingers and place your finger in their palm, they will curl their finger around yours.

  This is the palmar grasp reflex. As a baby's nervous system matures, their fists will begin to relax and they will gain more control over their movements.

  By 4 months old, most babies will begin to reach out towards an item such as a toy dangling from above.

  At around 6 months old, most babies will begin to pass items from hand to hand.

  Around 9 to 10 months, most babies will develop their pincer grasp where they are able to hold and control items between their thumb and forefinger. Before this, babies will hold everything in a fist grasp.

  Between the ages of 2 and 3 years, children will grow in confidence and control when using cutlery, crayons, and paintbrushes.

  By 3 years old, most children have developed good hand and eye coordination to be able to use these tools independently.

  From 3 or 4 years old, some children may show signs of being ready to start trying the tripod grip to start trying the tripod grip for tools like pens and paintbrushes. Practitioners can encourage this where appropriate.
