# Working with parents to support and encourage physical development

  Working closely in partnership with families is absolutely crucial for a child's physical development. It gives them an opportunity to practise in their home learning environment.

  Now you're going to see some examples of how practitioners and families work together to support their children's physical development milestones. We let parents know exactly what children could be doing for their age because I think it's important that parents have that EYFS knowledge too.

  - He's done lots of threading and some playdough so heâ€™s been very busy.

  So we let them know via parents' mornings, parents' evenings, and then we just have real open and honest conversations on handovers.

  - Is there anything that you'd like us to do at home to help with what you've done today?

  Painting and crayons.

  So he could also do large and small motor movements with his hands.

  We let them know what they've done throughout that day and what they could be doing at home to challenge them a little bit more.

  We do encourage home learning with our parents.

  - He put one arm in his own coat today.
  - Oh wow.
  - He needed a bit of help with the second one. But I can tell you're doing his homework,  Mummy.

  And these are generally based around physical development needs, such as learning to take your coat off, put it on, learning to zip it up when we're a bit older, learning to do little buttons.

  We ask the parents if they can help join in with housework. This encourages gross motor skills. They're lifting up high and they're picking little bits up off the floor, dusting. So it's really, really good to engage our parents with their learning.

  One of the ways we engage parents to engage with the children's physical development is we encourage parents to attend our workshops. And in our workshops we talk to the parents about activities that you could do with your child at home.

  - And try really hard to let them have a go at drinking from an open cup because it's better for their development.

  So we encourage them to maybe take them to the park, encourage your child to go onto climbing equipment and encourage them to go over, under, slide down the slides.

  And then we say to them, when you take your child out, work with them, see what you can see. Take pictures, send them to us.

  We're always talking to parents about their children's physical development. We'll speak to them each day about what activities their child's done and anything that they might have achieved. We will then speak to parents about how they can encourage their child to do this at home. For example, if a child has pulled themselves up for the first time that day, we will tell parents to encourage them to do it at home using a safe piece of furniture.

  So when we're talking to parents, particularly about mealtimes, it's really important that parents engage with us in the way that we're trying to develop their children physically. Parents need to allow their children to feed themselves independently. It's perfectly okay to use their fingers to eat food because that's a natural stage of development. The physical development with children is all about using utensils to cut their food and to really have a go, and parents really need to embrace that at home as well.

  The nursery has been absolutely fantastic at promoting good practice. So, for example, they've been encouraging him to put his own coat on and do it up. So we now know that at home before we go to nursery he's got to do his own coat up, and he's trying to do his shoelaces up. Again, that's encouraged by nursery. Just so pleased that he's developing his own physical skills.

  What I really appreciate about nursery is the really good communication with home. For example, my son is in the pre-school, so they model with us the tripod grip. They show us how he's doing it and then we can emulate that at home.

  I'm a first time mum so I'm not really sure about physical development. So one of the things that the nursery have taught me is how to help my daughter at home with things like fine motor skills. So we've recently bought some pincers, some tongs, and she picks up little dinosaurs and puts them in the correct colour bowl. Her motor skills have improved so much from doing little things like that.

  The nursery are always updating me on what milestones my children have met

  - So they're doing really, really well with their gross skills, okay? So it's your running, your jumping, and your skipping, and climbing outdoors

  and what we can do at home, for example, like playdough, which helps the children to use their fingers and their hands to build up their muscles. From the advice given I can see at home the milestones that they have reached and what the next targets are.
