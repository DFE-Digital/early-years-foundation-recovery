  Today, we're taking a look at language development and the strategies you can use to support children's learning.

  As a practitioner, there are 4 main strategies to consider.

  First, let's talk about Expansion.

  Expansion is where you expand what a baby or child is saying and model their communication back to them.

  For example, if a toddler gestures to a picture of a cow and says "cow", you can expand this by saying

  Child: "A cow"

  Practitioner: "A cow! A big cow. Is it a big brown cow? Look, and then he's got big horns. And what's this?"
  
  Child: "Tongue!"
  
  Practitioner: "It's tongue!"

  As children attempt to put 2 words together, they may say phrases such as "drink cup". You can model back a fuller response such as "Would you like a drink in a cup?"

  Narration

  Narration is when you add a running commentary to your everyday actions.

  Practitioner: "Let's start with your socks. Can you help put your socks on?"
  
  Child: "Yeah!"
  
  Practitioner: "Can you turn them around the right way?"
  
  Child: "Do you have to stretch them?"
  
  Practitioner: "Stretch them a bit, yeah"

  It allows children to hear new vocabulary and learn about the environment around them. For example, when changing a baby's nappy, you could say, "Let's find your wipes and a clean nappy."

  Practitioner: "Do you want Magdalena to change your nappy?"
  
  Practitioner: "Yeah?"
  
  Practitioner: "You clever girl!"

  And with older children, you could add commentary such as "I'm going to put these books away now."

  Practitioner: "I'm going to put this one back in here."
  
  Practitioner: "Oh, 'Some Dogs Do'!"

  Reasoning

  Reasoning can encourage children to make sense of the things around them.

  As a practitioner, you should use comments and questions to encourage children to think about actions and objects in more detail. For example, if children are playing in the sand tray, you could encourage them to consider if some buckets hold more sand than others and ask why that is.

  Positive feedback

  Finally, you can support language development through providing positive feedback when children communicate. Positive feedback can include making eye contact, smiling, or offering verbal praise.

  Practitioner: "Oh my goodness me, well done!"
  
  Practitioner: "That was really good, high five!"
