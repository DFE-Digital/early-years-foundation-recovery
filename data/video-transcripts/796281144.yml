  In this video practitioners explain how you can help support children with managing their feelings and how they regulate their behaviour.

  The practitioners are:

    - Rahima, class teacher
    - Julian, headteacher
    - Adam, class teacher
    - Zara, early years educator

  Rahima:

  Self-regulation is our ability to adapt, adjust, and control our emotions, actions, and thoughts.

  We have looked at how we can support children to recognise and name these feelings, but it is also important for us to support children in how they manage these feelings and how they regulate the behaviour that comes with these emotions.

  Rahima: “So it's time for us now to move over to the calm zone so you're ready to learn.”

  Julian:

  When we think about self-regulation in early childhood, we're really thinking about two aspects: emotional self-regulation and cognitive self-regulation. And they're both key to children's happy and healthy development.

  Emotional self-regulation is where children become more aware of their feelings and increasingly are able to manage them in an appropriate way, but it is a journey.

  So we do expect to see young children sometimes struggle. They need that calm reassurance, love and care from staff.

  Karla:

  So a very common time for a child to become upset and need some help with self-regulation is during separation from the parent.

  Child: “I don't want you to go.”

  This is when relationships really come into it. I have to really know the child. They have to really trust me, know that they're safe with me, safe in their environment.

  And we just give it time and reassurance until they're settled and they can join in.

  Adam:

  One of the things that I use is these emotion cards, which really help children name their feelings and also find ways of managing those feelings.

  Children tell me they're feeling happy when they're feeling happy. And we can say, great. So what would you like to do now you're feeling happy? I might want to sing, or I might want to give a high five, or do some dancing.

  It's about helping children understand their own feelings and deal with their own feelings as well. Likewise, when children are feeling sad, they do find it hard to identify themselves as feeling sad. They might just come up and show that they're feeling upset. So we show them these, we name the feelings for them, and then they can find their own solutions to it.

  So I can see you're feeling sad. Would you like to tell someone about it? Would you like to find a friend? Or do you need a hug?

  And they can choose a solution, so they are learning to manage those feelings themselves.

  Zara:

  First of all, I think it's so important to have a very strong relationship with your child, that key person and child relationship, right from the beginning.

  Getting to know the child and gathering information about their likes, what they don't like, what motivates them, as well as finding out what parents do at home.

  Parent: “He went downstairs. He played a lot with the snow.”

  Telling children how I regulate my own feelings and labelling my emotions, and encouraging children to do the same.

  Zara: “I know that a lot of us might be in the yellow zone. We might be feeling a little bit silly and a little bit excited.”

  Taking deep breaths is something that really works.

  Zara: “In. Out. Are we feeling better? Yeah.”

  A great example that I can give you is from one of my key children who finds saying bye to her parent and coming into the classroom challenging at times.

  So for me, as her key person, I am there to welcome her. I'm there to have a consistent routine and consistent responses for her to help her feel better.

  Labelling her emotions for her.

  Practitioner: “Sadness can make you…”

  Practitioner and children: “ …cry.”

  Practitioner: “It can make you feel…

  Practitioner and children: “...alone.”

  And getting her ready to start her day and begin learning and playing.

  Julian:

  Cognitive self-regulation is children's increasing ability to focus on what it is that they're doing and screen out all of the noise around them, to bounce back when something is difficult.

  And as adults, we can help them with that by encouraging them to keep going when something is hard or talk about what it is they're planning to do before they start off so that they can think about the steps they're going to take to carry out their plan.

  Rahima:

  Examples of this type of support will aid children in developing their own self-regulatory skills and support them in their development across all areas of learning.
