  Balancing adult and child led activities

  Today's subject is based on balancing child and adult-led activities and how to effectively plan and structure these to help develop and secure children's learning through the Early Years Foundation stage. 

  Structuring activities with clear boundaries means that children have a clear understanding of what you expect them to learn, and it's important to note that all children have individual needs, therefore you should tailor your instructions and resources based on their individual starting point. As well as this, you should always plan any adult led activities with a specific learning aim in mind. 

  There are several ways in which you could run the activities - either in large groups, smaller groups or on a 1-1 basis, so let's look at an example of  adult led learning. 

  Here a practitioner is leading a planned story time and a creative activity about mini beasts with a group of 3 year olds. 

  Through this activity the practitioner is looking to:

  Extend the children's vocabulary
  Support the development of fine motor skills
  …And encourage imaginative play

  You can also use these opportunities to role model expected behaviour, such as the importance of listening to peers, taking turns and building positive relationships, which will help with independent learning.

  So let's look at the child led activity that follows.

  The children have gone outside and started a bug hunt. They are using the new vocabulary they have learnt during the story time and some of them are pretending to be bugs, acting out the story. 

  You can create the environment for this to happen by planning and having the correct resources, such as:
  bug nets, magnifying glasses and dress up clothes
  …stories about bugs in your story time space 
  …and bug shapes to paint in your creative area

  You can also look out for opportunities to ask open questions about bugs to extend the children's language. And you can scaffold responses (offering temporary levels of successive support) to children's questions to help them interact confidently with one another when using the new vocabulary you have introduced.

  It is important to think about how you assess the impact of these activities too. For example, you may have observed great language, creativity and communication skills when the children initiated acting out the bug story and equally you may have observed some children not fully securing the vocabulary you intended, or others needing more practice when it comes to gripping fiddly objects. You can then plan further activities to build skills in these particular areas to support each child's individual learning. 

  When planning, you should think about what individual children and groups need to know or what they need to do in order to develop and secure their learning. This will help make sure you are supporting children to develop through the Early Years Foundation Stage.
