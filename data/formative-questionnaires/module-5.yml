        body: |
          Which of the following will gross motor activity help to develop?
        assessment_summary: |
          Activities and opportunities that promote gross motor skills will help to develop:

          - spatial awareness

          - stability
          - balance
          - co-ordination
          - agility

          Gross motor skills, together with fine motor skills also support weaning, as NHS advice is to only start weaning when a baby can stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady.

          Early gross motor development will promote a healthy lifestyle in later life. It is important to plan an environment and curriculum that promotes gross motor activities.
