          True or false?

          Babies understand expressive language before receptive language.
        assessment_summary: |
          Babies will understand what they hear (receptive language) before they are able to express themselves (expressive language).
          This is why it is important to constantly talk to babies and narrate whatever you are doing.

        assessment_summary: |
          To begin with children will recognise and attempt to use nouns such as ‘dog’, ‘ball’, ‘cup’. Next will come understanding of verbs such as ‘drink’, ‘eat’, ‘walk’. Understanding of adjectives such as ‘small’, ‘red’, ‘cold’ will then follow.

          You can support children by extending their use of a noun. For example if a child says ‘cup’ you can say “yes, you are drinking from a yellow cup”.

          What is the best action to take if a child does not use the correct pronounciation or grammar? (Select one answer)
        assessment_summary: |
          You should model the correct use of language.

          For example, a child may say “I drawed a picture for you”. Your response could be “that’s right, you drew a picture for me”.

          This will provide opportunity for the child to learn by imitation.

          Sustained shared thinking can extend children's vocabulary.
        assessment_summary: |
          You can support language development by encouraging children to:

          - work with others to solve problems
          - take part in discussions
          - share stories
          - investigate

          This is called sustained shared thinking.
          This will lead to extended discussions and questions, which will result in opportunities to hear and practice new vocabulary.

    questions:
      1_skinner_theory:
        multi_select: false
        body: |
          True or false?

          The main principles of Skinner’s theory were imitation, reinforcement and conditioning.
        assessment_summary: |
          Skinner’s theory had 3 principles which were imitation, reinforcement and conditioning.

          Skinner believed that children are born with a blank mind and develop their language skills through learning and opportunity to mimic others.
          Skinner believed that the response to the behaviour would shape future behaviour.

          For example if you talk to a baby or child, they will be able to try and respond by copying your behaviour.
          You can then reinforce their attempts with verbal praise, a smile and another response.
          The child will then want to repeat this behaviour to receive another positive response and this will promote their development.

          Which theorist did not believe that social and emotional relationships were important for children's language development?
        assessment_summary: |
          Piaget did not think that social and emotional relationships were important.
          Instead he believed that children need to understand a word before they can use it.

          In contrast, Bruner and Skinner thought that interactions with others were crucial to support language development.

          Chomsky believes that children learn language instinctively.
        assessment_summary: |
          Chomsky suggests that all children have the instinct and ability to develop their language skills, regardless of how and where they grow up. It is important to remember that this may not always be the case for all children.

          Children will all develop at their own individual pace. You will also need to take into account contributing factors, such as learning difficulties.
