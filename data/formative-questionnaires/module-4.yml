          This will provide opportunity for the child to learn by imitation.

      1_skinner_theory:
        multi_select: false
        label: |
          True or false? The main principles of Skinner’s theory were imitation, reinforcement and conditioning.
        assessment_summary: |
          Skinner’s theory had 3 principles which were imitation, reinforcement and conditioning.

          Skinner believed that children are born with a blank mind and develop their language skills through learning and opportunity to mimic others.
          Skinner believed that the response to the behaviour would shape future behaviour.

          For example if you talk to a baby or child, they will be able to try and respond by copying your behaviour.
          You can then reinforce their attempts with verbal praise, a smile and another response.
          The child will then want to repeat this behaviour to receive another positive response and this will promote their development.

          It is important to remember that this may not always be the case for all children.
          Children will all develop at their own individual pace.
          You will also need to take into account contributing factors, such as learning difficulties.
