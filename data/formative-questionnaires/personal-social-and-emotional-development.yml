          When Benjamin chooses dresses and heeled shoes, his friends laugh and make
          jokes and often choose not to play with him.

          What should you do?
        assessment_summary: |
          You should intervene, as this is an opportunity for you to support children’s understanding of accepting individuality. Initially this intervention could be a spontaneous discussion where the children involved are encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings.

          Planned activities could also include:

          - use of puppets or structured role play to encourage expression of feelings and thoughts
          - shared stories relating to unkind actions and the resulting feelings

          You should not wait to see how Benjamin reacts, as this may lead to difficulties and confusion for him around managing feelings and building positive relationships.

          You also should not stop Benjamin from playing with the items, as all children should have the freedom to play with whatever they choose without fear of being teased.

          1: Wait to see how Benjamin reacts
          2: Intervene
          3: Stop Benjamin from playing with the items to prevent him from being teased

          What is the term used to describe the potential impact aspects of their

        assessment_summary: |
          ‘Overstimulation’ is the term used to describe the potential impact aspects of the environment such as noise, light, or crowds can have on children. When children become overstimulated, their responses may be interpreted as challenging or unwanted behaviour.

          In your setting, children will benefit from a designated quiet area that they know they can retreat to if things become too much. A knowledge of children’s interests can also be helpful here, as they can be used as a distraction.

        assessment_summary: |
          Redirection is an effective strategy for children aged 18 to 36 months,
          as redirection strategies will help to shape and guide their behaviour.
          For example, instead of telling a child “don’t shout”, you could say
          “can we talk quietly please? Your friends are sleeping”.
          This is because asking the child not to shout does not guide them to the
          behaviour you are looking for, or explain why you need them to behave differently.
