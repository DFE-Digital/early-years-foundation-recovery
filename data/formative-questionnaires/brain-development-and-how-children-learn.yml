        body: |
         What did Jean Piaget label the 0 to 2 year stage of child development?
        assessment_summary: |
          Piaget labelled the 0 to 2 years old stage of development as the sensorimotor stage. In this stage, babies use their senses to explore and grow.

          You can support babies' understanding of the world around them by providing sensory rich environments. For example, while teaching them the word 'banana', babies might be able to repeat the word but might not know what a banana is. If a baby gets to see, touch, smell and taste a banana, they will be able to complete the view in their mind that the word banana is the yellow fruit that tastes like this and smells like that.

          - a supportive environment to promote development
          - social interaction and peer teaching to promote development
          - opportunities to test inconsistencies to promote development
