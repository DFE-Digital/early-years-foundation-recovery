          At approximately what age will children get excited to be with other children, but continue to play alongside and not with them?

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          At 2 years old children will be copying those around them. They will get excited to be with other children, even though they continue to mainly play alongside others and not with them. They will start to play imaginative games and become more independent, although this will also be accompanied by increased defiance.

        assessment_summary:

        label: |
          Providing a quiet area within the setting will help to prevent which of the following? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Some children can become overstimulated by their environment. This can present as frustration or challenging behaviour. Children may not be familiar with the wealth of activity and interaction being offered. Shy and reticent children and those with SEND will also benefit from a quiet area.

        label: How many stages of separation anxiety did Bowlby identify?
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Bowlby identified 3 stages of separation anxiety. 
        
          In the first stage, protest, children may scream, kick, show anger and try to escape. 
        
          During the second stage, despair, it may seem as though children have accepted the separation. However, they will appear withdrawn and may display self-soothing techniques. 
        
          In the third and final stage, detachment, children may lose their trust in people. Bowlby suggested that this stage will apply when children are separated from their most significant attachment for a longer period of time.

          Effective communication between practitioners and parents will result in what kind of expectations for children? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          When everyone has realistic expectations, the child will have the freedom to learn in supportive environments. When there is effective communication between practitioners and parents, everyone caring for the child will have a full understanding of their needs, preferences and level of development. This will support better understanding of both the child’s current skills and the plan to promote progress.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          That’s not quite right. Proprioceptive activities are weight bearing activities like walking, crawling and running which can support self-regulation, help children to focus and calm sensory overload.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          At approximately 12 to 18 months old, children start to develop an awareness of social expectations and are able to change their behaviour when asked, if clearly directed and supported by an adult.

        label: |
          True or false? Visual reminders will positively support children to develop their self-regulation skills.
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Visual reminders can help children to develop their self-regulation skills. For example, a child may call out every time they have a thought as they struggle to control the impulse to share the information. A visual reminder to put up their hand and wait, or write their thought down until a more appropriate moment, will help the child to remember the appropriate behaviour for the situation.
