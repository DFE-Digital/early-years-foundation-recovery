          At approximately what age will children get excited to be with other children,
          but continue to play alongside and not with them?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          At 2 years old children will be copying those around them.
          They will get excited to be with other children, even though they continue
          to mainly play alongside others and not with them.
          They will start to play imaginative games and become more independent,
          although this will also be accompanied by increased defiance.

          enthusiasm and motivation.

          Providing a quiet area within the setting will help to prevent which of the following?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Some children can become overstimulated by their environment. This can be presented as behaviour that you may find challenging. Children may not be familiar with the wealth of activity and interaction being offered. Children who are unsure and those with SEND will also benefit from a quiet area.

        label: How many stages of separation anxiety did Bowlby identify?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Bowlby identified 3 stages of separation anxiety.

          In the first stage, protest, children may scream, kick, show anger and try to escape.

          During the second stage, despair, it may seem as though children have accepted the separation.
          However, they will appear withdrawn and may display self-soothing techniques.

          In the third and final stage, detachment, children may lose their trust in people.
          Bowlby suggested that this stage will apply when children are separated from their
          most significant attachment for a longer period of time.

          Effective communication between practitioners and parents will result
          in what kind of expectations for children?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          When everyone has realistic expectations, the child will have the freedom
          to learn in supportive environments. When there is effective communication
          between practitioners and parents, everyone caring for the child will have a
          full understanding of their needs, preferences and level of development.
          This will support better understanding of both the child's current skills and
          the plan to promote progress.

          True or false?

          Quiet activities will positively support children to develop
          their self-regulation skills.
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          All children need opportunities to access quieter areas and take time to rest and process their thoughts. This is even more important for children who are still developing their skills or having difficulty self-regulating.

          Encourage children to think of the quiet area as a calming, safe space. Older children will become aware that they can move to this space, and eventually work towards moving there before their behaviour becomes uncontrolled.
