        multi_select: false
        label: |
          True or false?

          If a child in your care is struggling with their learning, you should not tell their parents or carers, so as to avoid worrying them.

          The foundations of parent and carer partnerships are built on trust. It is crucial that you are able to talk honestly with parents and carers to ensure they fully appreciate their child’s needs. This includes explaining to parents when children need additional support and how they can help at home to enable their child to flourish.

      1_successive_support:
        multi_select: false

          Which of the following is the process practitioners can use to give children temporary levels of successive support?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Scaffolding offers children temporary levels of successive support that help them to tackle more challenging tasks and build on existing learning. It helps children to develop their confidence and self belief. This means they will be secure in their knowledge and skills before becoming ready to attempt the next challenge.

          You can use your knowledge of child development and of each child’s communication skills to scaffold and set the correct pace of learning. You can then consider what you would like to aim towards next.

          Holistic learning:

          - encourages children to be curious as they consider concepts and topics from more than one perspective

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          During the pandemic, some children will have been able to play with number related apps  and games that help build their mathematics skills. They may also have been involved in practical activities such as cooking, which require them to weigh and measure.

          Children may also have:

          - had access to toys, games and jigsaws that require problem solving and matching
          - explored mathematical concepts such as time, shape and distance through interactions with their parents or carers

          Acknowledging small achievements can encourage children to try more challenging tasks.
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          It is important to recognise and celebrate children’s accomplishments. Even where the accomplishment might be considered small it is essential that the child feels recognised for their achievement. This will encourage children to attempt more challenging tasks, even when there is an opportunity for them to make a mistake, as they will seek that acknowledgement again.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Children are constantly learning and require an ambitious curriculum that gives them the opportunity to make sense of their thoughts and experiences and considers their:

          - identity and culture
          - interests and learning needs
          - individual communication needs
          - previous experiences

          Children’s learning and development opportunities will be maximised in environments that are varied, that offer challenge with minimised risk and where children are protected from harm and abuse.

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Child-led activities allow children to trial new ideas without any expectation, often leading to increased imagination and creativity.

          They can allow children to attempt an activity independently without worrying about the outcome, often leading to skill development and increased independence.

          They also give children the opportunity to navigate social skills such as sharing, turn taking and negotiating the views of others with minimal intervention from practitioners

          In contrast, adult-led activities will ensure that all children can be actively involved. This will be because you have differentiated the activity. You can make sure all children are engaged in conversation opportunities. Across a planned period of time all children will be encouraged to participate.

          Due to the planning needed, effective assessment will require practitioners to be away from children for prolonged periods.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Successful assessment is key to helping you identify children’s starting points and planning appropriate environments and experiences to support progress.

          Effective assessment should:

          - not take practitioners away from children for prolonged periods
          - be well planned
          - clearly inform practitioners about next steps
