        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Fundamental movement skills are divided into three different skill sets: manipulation, locomotor and stability.

          Manipulation skills support us to control objects. Locomotor skills include running, galloping,hopping, skipping, dodging, leaping, twisting and dodging. Stability skills are those needed to control our body and include stopping, stretching, landing, twisting and climbing.

          At what age do children tend to show an increased desire to be independent?
        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Between 25 and 36 months children will be showing an increased desire to be independent. This is a perfect opportunity to encourage skills whilst dressing and undressing, during mealtimes and with self care such as washing hands and toileting.

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development (ZPD) theory states that children have 2 stages of development.

          The first stage is the skills and knowledge they can develop by themselves. The second stage is the learning that can take place with the support of a more experienced individual. Vygotsky believed this learning support could come from other children, and not just adults, as long as the other child was more knowledgeable. He also stressed the importance of play for developing skills and learning new concepts.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          The Eatwell Guide, published by the NHS, shows how much of what we eat overall should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.

          Children will need to eat a balance of all the food groups to support and promote physical development. More information can be found on the example menus, linked to in the further reading section of this module. You can use these example menus to offer healthy, balanced and nutritious meals for children.

          Which of the following can be improved significantly when children take part in regular physical activity?

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Being active can positively support children’s mental health. Being able to practise and master a skill, for example throwing and catching a ball with control, can help to build a child’s confidence.

          You will need to make sure that children can access activities that are achievable with appropriate challenge and support. If a child is not able to make progress, even small steps, they will not feel this sense of achievement. It is important that you know about each child’s starting point with physical skills to ensure that you can plan a suitable environment and activities.

          True or false, a child’s physical development can affect their self-efficacy?

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          A child’s ability to access and use toys, feed themselves and participate in activities will affect their confidence. Where children have confidence in their physical ability, they are more likely to have high self-efficacy. This means they will tackle situations believing that they can succeed. Children with high self-efficacy and resilience are more likely to take part and persevere in activities and environments that they find challenging.

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Physical literacy is the confidence, motivation and skill levels needed to take part in physical activities. You can promote physical literacy by:

          - providing a wealth of activities that support children’s physical skills
          - making physical activity part of a regular routine
          - being a good role model
          - offering lots of praise and encouragement for engagement in physical activities
          - introducing and reinforcing language relating to movement and physical skills

        assessment_summary:
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Children who regularly access outdoor environments are likely to have improved strength, agility and co-ordination. This is because running, climbing and swinging use different movements, muscles and control to those needed for indoor movement.

          Children who have opportunities to test and develop new movement skills may also develop greater self confidence.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Children’s experiences of physical activity outside of the setting will vary greatly and there are many factors which may influence this including parents having limited time or understanding of expected development.

          You will need to be aware of children’s previous experiences to ensure that you can plan from children’s starting points.

          Bad weather can sometimes limit children’s outdoor activity, but with the exception of lightning and bad storms there are safe ways to enjoy outdoor activity in most weather conditions.
