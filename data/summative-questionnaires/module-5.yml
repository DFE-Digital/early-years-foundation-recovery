        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Fundamental motor skills are divided into three different skill sets: manipulation, locomotor and stability. 

          Manipulation skills support us to control objects, locomotor skills  include running, galloping,hopping, skipping,dodging, leaping, twisting and dodging. Stability skills are those 

          needed to control our body and include stopping,, stretching,, landing, twisting and,climbing

          During this period, with the correct support, gross motor skills will develop to include:

          - sitting without support
          - beginning to crawl 
          - standing while holding onto something

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Between 25 and 36 months children will be showing an increased desire to be independent. This is a perfect opportunity to encourage skills whilst dressing and undressing, during mealtimes and with self care such as washing hands and toileting.

        label: |
          Which of the following was not a key principle of Gesell’s research? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Gesell did not think that stimulation was essential but suggested that internal factors such as the growth of the child’s nervous system underpinned a child’s development regardless of the interactions they experienced.
          
          Criticisms of Gesell’s work and more recent research shows us that children benefit most when we have a clear understanding of their developmental level and use the interactions of others to support this.

          1: "All children travel through a set of predictable milestones but do so at their own pace "
          2: "The pace of a child's development is determined by their internal physical and mental development"
          3: "Any delays that were experienced are as a result of hereditary factors"

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Children will need to eat a balance of all the food groups to support and promote physical development. More information can be found on the example menus, linked to in the further reading section of this module. You can use these example menus to offer healthy, balanced and nutritious meals for children.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          If a child lacks the communication skills to express their needs it could result in frustration. If children become frustrated it can be shown as negative behaviour.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Self talk and parallel talk are both ways that you can model language for children. This is where you add commentary to tasks and actions to make sure that children hear a wide variety of vocabulary

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Parents and carers are the most knowledgeable person regarding their child and they will be able to share lots of information to support you. Finding out about experiences, siblings and interests will help you to plan to meet their language needs. The information you learn will support you to build a sense of security, which will result in more confidence when communicating.
