        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Fundamental motor skills are divided into three different skill sets: manipulation, locomotor and stability. 

          Manipulation skills support us to control objects, locomotor skills  include running, galloping,hopping, skipping,dodging, leaping, twisting and dodging. Stability skills are those 

          needed to control our body and include stopping,, stretching,, landing, twisting and,climbing

          During this period, with the correct support, gross motor skills will develop to include:

          - sitting without support
          - beginning to crawl 
          - standing while holding onto something

          At what age do children show an increased desire to be independent?
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Between 25 and 36 months children will be showing an increased desire to be independent. This is a perfect opportunity to encourage skills whilst dressing and undressing, during mealtimes and with self care such as washing hands and toileting.

          Which of the following was not a key principle of Gesell’s research? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Gesell did not think that stimulation was essential but suggested that internal factors such as the growth of the child’s nervous system underpinned a child’s development regardless of the interactions they experienced.
          
          Criticisms of Gesell’s work and more recent research shows us that children benefit most when we have a clear understanding of their developmental level and use the interactions of others to support this.

          1: "All children travel through a set of predictable milestones but do so at their own pace "
          2: "The pace of a child's development is determined by their internal physical and mental development"
          3: "Any delays that were experienced are as a result of hereditary factors"
          4: "Children’s development is heavily influenced  by the interaction of others "

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          The Eatwell Guide, published by the NHS, shows how much of what we eat overall should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.

          Children will need to eat a balance of all the food groups to support and promote physical development. More information can be found on the example menus, linked to in the further reading section of this module. You can use these example menus to offer healthy, balanced and nutritious meals for children.

          Which of the following can be reduced significantly when children take part in regular physical activity?

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Being active can positively support children’s mental health. Being able to practice and master a skill, for example throwing and catching a ball with control, can help to build a child’s confidence. This will help to reduce the likelihood of children experiencing anxiety and depression. 
          
          You will need to make sure that children can access activities that are achievable with appropriate challenge and support. If a child is not able to make progress, even small steps, they will not feel this sense of achievement. It is important that you know about each child’s starting point with physical skills to ensure that you can plan a suitable environment and activities.

        multi_select: false

          Which of the following might be affected by a child’s limited physical skills?

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          A lack of independence as a result of limited physical skills or additional needs may impact upon a child’s feeling of self worth. This will impact on the child’s self efficacy and they will become more reluctant to try as they become overwhelmed by the thought that they cannot succeed. They will then become more and more dependent on others to meet their needs. 
          
          It is important that children are empowered to be ambitious for themselves. You will need to adapt your planning to set children small tasks that result in lots of praise and achievement.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          You will need to plan an active curriculum to ensure that children’s fine and gross motor skills are promoted. Being an enthusiastic role model will support children’s enthusiasm and motivation to be physically active.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Research shows us that children who regularly access outdoor environments have improved strength, agility and coordination as the freedom to run, climb and swing uses different movements, muscles and control to those needed for indoor movement. 
          
          Children who have opportunities to test and develop new movement skills also develop greater self confidence.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Children’s experiences of physical activity outside of the setting will vary greatly and there are many factors which may influence this including parents having limited time or understanding of expected development. 
          
          You will need to be aware of children’s previous experiences to ensure that you can plan from children’s starting points.
