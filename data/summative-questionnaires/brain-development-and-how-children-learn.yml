      1_myelin_neurones:
        multi_select: false 
        label: |
          True or false? When myelin coats the neurones, it decreases the speed that electrical impulses can travel.
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          The myelination process coats the neurones in a fatty substance called myelin and it increases the speed that electrical impulses can travel. 
          
          After birth, when a baby or young child repeats and practises a skill, it leads to myelination of the neurones involved. This increases the speed at which the message travels between neurones and so improves the skill.

          Prolonged exposure to negative influences such as social isolation, a lack of stimulation and limited exposure to language and communication will impact on all aspects of a child’s learning and development . Children may experience restricted language and communication difficulties, be more prone to mental health concerns and be unable to carry out basic tasks.

        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Research shows that children living in low income households are 3 times more likely to experience mental health issues and have lower academic success than children from more affluent backgrounds.Coming from a disadvantaged area or a household in poverty should not restrict a child’s chances to succeed. Being able to identify where a child requires support and addressing individual needs is essential to ensure the child can continue to progress.

          True or false? Children learn most effectively in an environment that offers a balance of both child and adult led activity.
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          A positive learning environment includes a balance of both adult and child led experiences. Children need to learn and receive guidance from adult interaction, but they also need time to process and explore the knowledge learnt through child initiated activity.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          ‘Cognitive development delay’ means that a child is at a lower level than the expected milestone. No child should ever be considered to be low ability, and every child is able to progress and achieve with the correct support. Maintaining your knowledge of expected development milestones will ensure you are able to intervene early and offer appropriate support to ensure every child can progress.
