          At what age would you expect babies to begin babbling?
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          At around 6 to 8 months most babies enter the babbling stage. This is where a baby will begin to make sounds such as ba-ba, da-da, ma-ma. This is the way that babies will learn, rehearse and develop future language skills.

          Which of the following is the last stage of language development before a child can speak fluently? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          The telegraphic stage is the last stage of language development before a child can speak fluently. This stage normally begins from around 2 years onwards.
          This is where children can put together more meaningful sentences. Sentences will still not be complete, and connecting or descriptive words will be missing. An example of telegraphic speech could be “cat drink milk”.

          Which of the following are one of the 3 principles of Skinner's "behaviourism" theory? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Skinner’s “behaviourism” theory has 3 principles:

          - imitation - where a child has the opportunity to observe and copy behaviour 
          - reinforcement - where a child receives a positive or negative response to their behaviour 
          - conditioning - where a child’s learning is shaped by their experiences

          Which of the following is a socio-economic factor that could affect language development? 
        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Some parents or carers who have experienced negative or limited learning opportunities may not see the importance of supporting their child’s learning and development. For example if they do not appreciate the value of books and reading, they may not provide these opportunities for their child.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Early intervention is when you identify a difficulty as soon as possible and use appropriate activities to support development.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          If a child lacks the communication skills to express their needs it could result in frustration. If children become frustrated it can be shown as negative behaviour.

        assessment_summary:

          Observations and the recording of them should not be time consuming or take you away from interacting with the children.

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Self talk and parallel talk are both ways that you can model language for children. This is where you add commentary to tasks and actions to make sure that children hear a wide variety of vocabulary

        assessment_summary: 
        assessment_fail_summary: |
          Parents and carers are the most knowledgeable person regarding their child and they will be able to share lots of information to support you. Finding out about experiences, siblings and interests will help you to plan to meet their language needs. The information you learn will support you to build a sense of security, which will result in more confidence when communicating.
