          At around 6 to 8 months most babies enter the babbling stage. This is where a baby will begin to make sounds such as ba-ba, da-da,ma-ma. This is the way that babies will learn, rehearse and develop future language skills.

          The telegraphic stage is the last stage of language development before a child can speak fluently. This stage normally begins from around 2 years onwards.
          This is where children can put together more meaningful sentences. Sentences will still not be complete, and connecting or descriptive words will be missing. An example of telegraphic speech could be “cat drink milk”.

          Skinner’s “behaviourism” theory has 3 principles:

          - imitation - where a child has the opportunity to observe and copy behaviour 
          - reinforcement - where a child receives a positive or negative response to their behaviour 
          - conditioning - where a child’s learning is shaped by their experiences
