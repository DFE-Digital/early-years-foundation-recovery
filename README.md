This is a Rails 7 application using the [DfE template][rails-template].

Optionally create `.env` to override or set default variables like `DATABASE_URL`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the [repository][app-repo]
2. Install [git-secrets](#git-secrets)
3. Obtain the master keys
4. Start the server

## Rails Credentials

We use rails credentials to manage secrets; obtain the encryption keys from the dev team.

To edit, use either:

- `EDITOR=vi rails credentials:edit --environment <env>`.
- `./bin/docker-rails credentials:edit --environment <env>`

Full instructions can be found by running `rails credentials:help`

## Git Secrets

This will help to prevent unintentional commits of access keys.

- `brew install git-secrets`
- `cd /path/to/my/repo`
- `git secrets --install`
- `git secrets --register-aws`

Find advanced settings and other installation options at the [git-secrets project][git-secrets].

## Working locally

1. `$ asdf plugin add ruby`
1. `$ asdf install ruby`
1. `$ asdf plugin add postgres`
1. `$ asdf install postgres`
1. `$ asdf plugin add nodejs`
1. `$ asdf install nodejs`

**Development**

> Gemfile group :development

Use `bin/dev` to start the process workers (watching for changes to asset files).

**Testing**

> Gemfile group :test

Use `bin/rspec` to run the test suite under `/spec`.
Rails system specs use RackTest only for efficiency.

**Production**

Running locally in the production rails environment requires generating a self-signed certificate. Use `bin/docker-certs`

**UI Framework**

> Gemfile group :ui

Use `bin/qa` to run the test framework under `/ui` against a given URL.
These tests have additional dependencies:

- `brew install chromedriver geckodriver`
- `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/chromedriver` on Intel
- `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/chromedriver` on ARM

## Using Docker

Containerised services are available for use by developers and testers.
There are a number of convenience scripts to make working with **Docker** easier.
All containers for the project are named with the prefix `recovery_`.
The project uses chained **Docker Compose** files to prepare different environments.

These commands help maintain your containerised workspace:

- `bin/docker-build` creates tagged images for all the services
- `bin/docker-certs` generates a self-signed certificate for running the app in production
- `bin/docker-files` changes the ownership of files to your current user, files
    generated inside containers are created by *root*
- `bin/docker-down` stop any active services
- `bin/docker-prune` purge project containers, volumes and images

The commands run common tasks inside containers:

- `bin/docker-adr` rebuilds the architecture decision records table of contents
- `bin/docker-dev` starts `Procfile.dev`, containerised equivalent of `bin/dev`,
    using the `docker-compose.dev.yml` override
    Additionally, it will install bundle and yarn dependencies.
- `bin/docker-rails erd` generate an Entity Relationship Diagram
- `bin/docker-rails db:seed` populates the containerised postgres database
- `bin/docker-rails console` drops into a running development environment or starts one,
    containerised equivalent of `bin/rails console`
- `bin/docker-rspec -f doc` runs the test suite with optional arguments, containerised
    equivalent of `bin/rspec`
- `bin/docker-doc` runs a YARD documentation server
- `bin/docker-uml` exports UML diagrams as default PNGs
- `bin/docker-prod` starts rails in production under `https`
- `bin/docker-qa` runs the browser tests against a running production application,
    a containerised equivalent of `bin/qa`
- `bin/docker-pa11y` runs WCAG checks against a generated `sitemap.xml`

These commands can be used to debug problems:

- `docker ps` lists all active **Docker** processes
- `docker system prune` tidies up your system
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.<FILE>.yml --project-name recovery run --rm app`
    can help identify why the application is not running in either the `dev`, `test`, or `qa` contexts
- `BASE_URL=https://app:3000 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.qa.yml --project-name recovery up app` debug the UAT tests

## Using Rake

Custom tasks are namespaced under `eyfs`, list them using `rake --tasks eyfs`.

- `rake eyfs:bot`                   # Generate secure bot user
- `rake eyfs:jobs:plug_content`     # Que job to insert page view events for injected module items
- `rake eyfs:user_progress`         # Recalculate module completion time
- `rake eyfs:whats_new`             # Enable the post login 'What's new' page


Trigger a task on a deployed application in either the `ey-recovery-content` or `ey-recovery-staging` spaces, not `production`, using `bin/cf-task`.

- `./bin/cf-task pr-123 eyfs:bot`
- `./bin/cf-task dev eyfs:whats_new[email1@example.com,email2@example.com]`

Refer to this script for the steps necessary to ssh in and run a task manually.

## Deployment Pipeline

Visit the [Github Container Registry][ghcr].

### Development Space

[Development][development] is deployed automatically with the latest commit from `main`.

### Content Space

Manually adding the **"deployed"** label to a pull request in Github will cause it to be deployed.
This supports manual testing and content review in a production environment.

When a feature branch review application is deployed, the URL to access it is added as a comment
in the PR conversation in the format: <https://ey-recovery-pr-##.london.cloudapps.digital/>

Review applications are deployed with 3 seeded user accounts that share a restricted password.
This facilitates team members demoing content and functionality, so registration is not required.

### Staging Space

[Staging][staging] is deployed automatically when a candidate tag is pushed.

- `git checkout <ref/branch>`
- `git tag --force rc0.0.x`
- `git push --force origin rc0.0.x`

A tag can also be created and a deployment run from this [workflow][staging-workflow].
We intend to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Production Space

[Production][production] is deployed automatically when a version tag is pushed.

- `git checkout rc0.0.x`
- `git tag v0.0.x`
- `git push origin v0.0.x`

A tag can also be created and a deployment run from this [workflow][production-workflow].

## Autoscaling

Auto scaling policy is 
```
Scale up when CPU > 85%
Scale down when CPU < 30%
```

Created with the following commands:

1) Install autoscaling plugin:
```
cf install-plugin -r CF-Community app-autoscaler-plugin
```
2) Create an autoscaler service:

```
cf create-service autoscaler autoscaler-free-plan scale-ey-recovery
```

3) Bind the autoscaler service to the app:

```
cf bind-service ey-recovery scale-ey-recovery
```

Policy is found in `policy.json`

4) Attach the autoscaling policy to the app:

```
cf attach-autoscaling-policy ey-recovery policy.json
```

5) Observe the app scaling automatically:

```
cf autoscaling-history ey-recovery
```

For further information see [Managing apps - autoscaling]: https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/managing_apps.html#autoscaling

The link includes additional examples for policies e.g. adding a schedule to scale at certain times or days of the month

## Monitoring

[Sentry][sentry] is used to monitor production environments

`$ brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli`

`$ sentry-cli projects list --org early-years-foundation-reform`

    +---------+--------------+-------------------------------+--------------+
    | ID      | Slug         | Team                          | Name         |
    +---------+--------------+-------------------------------+--------------+
    | 6274627 | eyf-reform   | early-years-foundation-reform | Rails        |
    | 6274651 | eyf-recovery | early-years-foundation-reform | eyf-recovery |
    +---------+--------------+-------------------------------+--------------+

## Quality Assurance

The UI/UA test suite can be run against any site.
A production-like application is available as a composed Docker service for local development.
To run a self-signed certificate must first be generated.

1. `./bin/docker-certs` (Mac users can trust the certificate in [Keychain Access](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access))
2. `./bin/docker-qa` (this will build and bring up the application with a clean database)
3. `./bin/docker-prod-reset` (clean and reseed the prerequisite user accounts)
4. `./bin/docker-qa` (retest)
4. `BASE_URL=https://deployment ./bin/docker-qa` (alternative test against another server)


## Accessibility Standards

An automated accessibility audit can be run against a development server running
in Docker using `./bin/docker-pa11y`. The test uses [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci)
and a dynamic `sitemap.xml` file to ensure the project meets [WCAG2AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) standards.
A secure HTTP header `BOT` is used to provide access to pages that require authentication.
The secret `$BOT_TOKEN` environment variable defines the account to seed.

```
curl -i -L -H "BOT: ${BOT_TOKEN}" http://localhost:3000/my-account
```

`docker-pa11y` accepts an optional argument to test external sites.

## Emails

Emails are sent using the [GOV.UK Notify][notify].

### Getting a GovUK Notify account

You need an account before you can use [GOV.UK Notify][notify] to send emails.
To obtain one ask a current member of the team to add you to the "Early Years Foundation Recovery" service,
by navigating to the `Team members` page and clicking the `Invite a team member`
button and entering a government email address.
This will send an email inviting you to use the service.

The credentials file for each environment holds an API key for [Notify][notify]:

- `railsdevelopment-...` Team and guest list (limits who you can send to)
- `railstest-...` Test (pretends to send messages)
- `railsproduction-...` Live (sends to anyone)

It is possible to temporarily override the key by defining `GOVUK_NOTIFY_API_KEY` in `.env`.

### Accessing information in the Notify service

Once you have an account you can view the `Dashboard` with details of how many
emails have been sent out and any that have failed to send.

You can update the content of the emails in the `Templates` section.

### For more information

Documentation for GovUK Notify can be found here: <https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/ruby.html>

The status of GovUK notify can be checked here: <https://status.notifications.service.gov.uk/>

For more information the Notify team can be contacted here: <https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support>,
or in the UK Government digital slack workspace in the `#govuk-notify` channel.

## User experience

Session timeout functionality:

- default timeout period is 25 minutes
- default timeout warning appears after 5 minutes
- screen readers announce every time the timeout refreshes every 15 secs

---

## Hotjar

This project uses Hotjar for user insight. Hotjar records user journeys and
automatically redacts certain user information on recordings. All personally
identifiable information should be redacted. In order to override the default
settings the following classes can be added:
- `data-hj-suppress` to redact additional user information
- `data-hj-allow` to allow data that is automatically redacted
